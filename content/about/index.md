Being the good cornfed American girl that I am, I didn't learn a second language growing up, and I ended up develop a nasty case of I now affectionately call *monoglot anxiety*: a sort of wallowing, often jealous panic surrounding having never learned to speak a second language, and fear of inevitably screwing up all the time if I *did* try to learn one. 

For years, it held me back, but eventually, it drove me bonkers enough to grind to the end of Duolingo German. 

Anxiety is, for the record, never the best reason to do anything (and Duolingo is, for the record, not necessarily the best way to start learning a language). But in the absence of other motivators, anxiety sometimes gets the job done. 

Anyways, one thing led to another and now I have a language blog.

I'm not an expertâ€”more an enthusiastic fan. I can't humble-brag on the 15 languages I've taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So you won't find promises of fluency in X amount of time here, nor any #inspiration. You *will* find what I hope is **an entertaining take on language and language learning, written by someone who's in this for fun, not perfection.** 

*Aside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you've taught yourself 15 languages... But just because you've earned it doesn't mean I have to like it!*

I write about all sort of language topics, but this blog definitely has a specific focus on German. I share a lot of **German-specific tips and resources**, including **new Anki decks and vocabulary lists every two weeks.**
