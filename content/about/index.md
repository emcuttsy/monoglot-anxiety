Hey, it's me — that annoying friend who always plays weird foreign music nobody likes at parties. 

In my defense, I wasn't always so annoying. Until just a few years ago, I was monolingual and I listened to weird music nobody liked in English. Despite years of language courses in high school and college, nothing ever clicked until I left classes behind and committed to learning on my own. Now, I'm approaching fluency in German and learning two more languages: Spanish and Danish.

Learning languages isn't witchcraft, and you definitely don't need to be some kind of hyperbrain megagenius or type-A, disciplined overachiever to do it. Learning languages is a skill — an accessible, learnable skill you can practice get better at with time. 

**If you want to learn how to learn languages, this blog is for you.**

I'm not a polyglot, and I'm not here to sell you on the specific learning method that worked for me. There are plenty of polyglot blogs out there that do that well, if that's what you're looking for. But after trying a lot of "best" strategies, I'm pretty convinced that "best" is always going to be different for different people — and that there definitely isn't some single magical hack that will catapault you to fluency in a week, a month, or a year.

So if this blog isn't going to tell you how to learn a  language, what *does* it do? Well, while this blog can't offer miracles, it can help you experiment wtih language learning to find what works best for you. It's a humble and I hope entertaining take on language learning viewed through the lens of my experience learning German, Spanish, and Danish. I write reviews, round up helpful resources, share my favorite media for immersion, and experiment with language-learning strategies as I learn to be a better learner — and I hope you'll join me as you grow as a language learner, too. I also put my background as a scientist and science journalist to work to break down the research (or lack thereof) behind popular language-learning strategies. 

The goal? To help you learn the best language-learning strategies for *you*. 

## Don't just learn your target language, learn to learn

**Learning languages is a skill that can be learned**, and that's what this blog is about. Knowing how to get, find the right resources for you, stay motivated, and navigate the intermediate plateau and beyond are all skills that will serve you well no matter what language you're learning. I also write also about **developing a healthier mindset about language learning** — overcoming any "monoglot anxiety" that might be holding you back. 

Here are a few of the things you can expect to find here:

* Honest reviews of language-learning resources to help you find what works best for you
* Science-backed assessments (and debunkings) of popular language learning trends and truisms
* Personal accounts of every stage of the language-learning journey from beginner to approaching fluency
* Anki tips and decks and guides to using this popular spaced-repetition system
* Suggestions for methods to try, especially for self-taught folks without tons of time for study
* Round-ups of the best free resources for language learning
* Lists of great German, Danish, and Spanish media to help you keep motivated — and tips for finding media and keeping motivated no matter what language you're studying
* <u>**No**</u> affiliate links, ads, or sponsorships
