Hey, it's me — that friend who always plays weird foreign music nobody likes at parties. 

In my defense, I wasn't always so annoying. Until just a year ago, I was monolingual and I listened to weird music nobody liked in English. Despite years of language courses in high school and college, nothing ever clicked until I left classes behind and committed to learning German on my own.

**This blog is about learning to teach yourself languages — getting started, finding the right resources, staying motivated, and navigating the intermediate plateau and beyond.** 

I'm not a polyglot. I can't tell you the "best" way to learn a language or some magic-trick language hack that will catapault you to fluency in a week, a month, or a year. If that's what you're looking for, you're in the wrong place.

I'm a language *learner*, and learning means lots of trial-and-error — especially if you're self-taught. And all that experimenting is exactly what Monoglot Anxiety is about.

If you're teaching yourself a language, this blog is for you. I write broadly about language-learning techniques through the lens of solo study, [review](/categories/reviews-recommendations/) popular language-learning methods, blogs, and resources, and walk through my own language learning mistakes so you don't have to make them yourself. If you happen to be learning [German](/categories/german/), [Italian](/categories/italian/), or [Danish](/categories/danish/), you can learn along with me and benefit from language-specific reviews, post-mortems of my most frequent mistakes, and lots of [free Anki decks and flashcard templates](/ankidecks/). I also write a [free newsletter for German learners](https://buttondown.email/monoglotanxiety) with media recommendations. And even if you're not learning German, Danish, or Italian along with me, I try to use each of these languages as a window into how language learning works at every stage from total beginner (Italian) to occasional dabbling (Danish) to approaching fluency (German).

Youu can get in touch by emailing hello@monoglotanxiety.com.
