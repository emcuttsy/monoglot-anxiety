Being the good cornfed American girl that I am, I didn't learn a second language growing up. Most of us do just fine beating everyone over the head with our English and never thinking twice about it, but I ended up develop a nasty case of I now affectionately call *monoglot anxiety*: anxiety about having never learned to speak a second language, and anxiety around inevitably screwing up all the time if I *did* try to learn one. And it really held me back.

Eventually, it drove me bonkers enough to grind all the way through Duolingo German. 

Anxiety is, for the record, never the best reason to do anything. But in the absence of other motivators, it sometimes gets the job done. And while there's still a way to go before I reach fluency, I've stuck with German.

Anyways, one thing led to another and now I have a language blog.

I'm not an expertâ€”more an enthusiastic fan. I can't humble-brag on the 15 languages I've taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So you won't find promises of fluency in X amount of time here, nor any #inspiration. What you *will* find is what I hope is **an entertaining take on language and language learning, written by someone who's in this for fun, not perfection.** 

*Aside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you've taught yourself 15 languages... But just because you've earned it doesn't mean I have to like it!*

I write about all sort of language topics. But I'm still learning German, so there's definitely a bit of a focus there. I share a lot of **German-specific tips and resources**, including new Anki decks and vocabulary lists every two weeks.
