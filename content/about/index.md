**Monoglot Anxiety is a blog about language learning with a focus on German and Danish.** You might also be forgiven for thinking that it's a blog about Anki, since I post a lot about Anki flashcards and make a lot of free Anki decks and templates.

I'm not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I speak German at between a B2 and C1 level and Danish at… -A1. I can't humble-brag on the 15 languages I've taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So instead of basing my posts on expertise, I base them on mistakes, trial-and-error, chance discoveries, and a good dose of self-deprecating humor. 

Most posts fall into one of three categories:

1. Explanations of grammar and usage inspired by the real mistakes I make while speaking
2. Reviews of and guides to language-learning resources 
3. Anki decks, card formats, and tricks for language learning (especially for German and Danish)

If you don't know where to start, check out [my Anki format for German flashcards](/blog/anki-format-for-german-that-automatically-generates-cloze-deletions-and-color-codes-nouns/), [my review of Pimsleur Danish](/blog/pimsleur-danish-review/), or, if you fancy a laugh, [my flashcard deck made exclusively of German words for drunk](/blog/booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/) complete with "cultural" notes generously provided by an Austrian native-speaker. 

And if you liked that last deck, be sure to check back on the first Friday of each month when I release a new "booster pack" of unnecessary but delightful German vocabulary you can add to your own Anki deck for free. 

Thanks for visiting, vielen Dank, and tusind tak.

*A quick aside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you've taught yourself 15 languages... But just because you've earned it doesn't mean I have to like it!*
