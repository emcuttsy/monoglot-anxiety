**My goal is to help you learn German without wanting to pull your hair out.** 

You might also be forgiven for thinking that my goal is to help you learn to use [Anki](/categories/anki/) without wanting to pull your hair out. And if you're here for Anki and not German, well, I guess I can help you too. But have you considered learning German? Great language. Very fun. Very easy :upside_down_face:

I'm not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I speak German at between a B2 and C1 level and obviously can't humble-brag on the 15 languages I've taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites (thus  the "monoglot" and "anxiety" in Monoglot Anxiety). So instead of basing my posts on polylingualism, I base them on mistakes, *lots* of trial-and-error, the odd scrap of hard-earned wisdom, and a good dose of self-deprecating humor.

*Aside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you've taught yourself 15 languages... But just because you've earned it doesn't mean I have to like it.*

You're in the right place if you'd like to… 

* **Use Anki to learn German faster and forget less**. Anki spaced repetition flashcards are one of the best tools out there for language learners. And it's about more than just vocabulary building—use Anki right, and you can intuitively learn grammar, correct your mistakes, and prepare for presentations or tests. I post tips for using Anki for language learning and create [free flashcard decks](/ankidecks/) to help your studies. I've also developed [smart flashcard templates](/ankidecks/card-templates/) that automate a lot of the boring, annoying parts of making your own flashcards.

* **Soak in authentic German content to get that sweet, sweet immersion**. German learners are lucky—the German-speaking world produces some *awesome* media to get lost in. And yes, there's a lot more out there than just Nena and Rammstein. I share awesome German music, shows, movies, podcasts, and more that you'll actually want to listen to and watch.

* **Know where to find the best (free) German textbooks, language-learning apps, online resources and other learning aides.** There is a *lot* of amazing content out there for German learners—if you know where to find it! I'm always trying out new things and writing about them here so you can discover new ways to improve your German. For instance, I'm currently working on putting together a guide to learning B2-level German grammar entirely with free online resources.

  

* **Waste less time and money on learning aides and strategies that don't work.** I write [reviews](/categories/reviews/) of popular products and language-learning methods for German learners so that you don't have to waste the money I already did.

  

* **Learn grammar by understanding common mistakes.** It's often easier to learn how *not* to do something wrong than how to do it right. I autopsy my own real German mistakes so you can see the gory guts of German grammar in action.

  

* **Grow your vocabulary with monthly flashcard "booser packs."** Once you're into the intermediate phase of language-learning life, building vocabulary gets a bit tricky. You know all the words you *need*, but what about the words you *want*? You know, the ones you have to talk around every time you chat with a German speaker? On the first Friday of every month, I post new ["booster packs" of obscure, niche, technical, taboo, hyperspecific, or otherwise "useless" words](/ankidecks/german-booster-packs/) that you won't find on your teacher's required vocabulary list—but that you *will* find out in the German-speaking world.

Sounds good, right? Of course, I sometimes post about other things, too. Often "other things" means Anki. But I dabble in [Danish](/categories/danish/) as well. 

And unlike a lot of sites out there, **I won't abandon you once you graduate from beginner-dom**. Oh no. One might even say that this blog is best for intermediate and advanced learners. I'm not here to hand-hold you through A1 and teach you the days of the week. I'm here to give you strategies that you can use to bridge the gap between basic proficiency and real fluency.

… but if you *do* want to be hand-held through A1, I guess I can point you to the best resources for that, too.

Vielen Dank!
