Anki flashcards are one of my favorite tools for language learning and I devote a lot of time, love, and anxiety to creating German Anki flashcards and card templates.

**Everything is free!** But if you want to say thanks, I wouldn't say no to a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/monoglotanxiety). 
Have any ideas for an Anki deck you'd like to see? I'd love to hear your suggestions at hello@monoglotanxiety.com. Monthly supporters get to vote on each month's theme. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy my flashcards and templates. Happy flashcarding!
