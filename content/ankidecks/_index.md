title: "Anki German Flashcards"
---

Anki flashcards are one of my favorite tools for language learning and I devote a lot of time, love, and anxiety to creating German Anki flashcards and card templates. All those free Anki decks and templates are listed here, and a **free vocabulary list and free basic flashcard deck** is available for every Anki deck.

My main flashcard project at the moment is making [**German vocabulary "booster packs"**](vocabulary-booster-packs/) of obscure, hyperspecific, taboo, slangy, or otherwise "useless" German vocabulary that you won't find on your course vocabulary list. Think things like the names of trees, 20 different words that mean drunk, and the translations of "cultist," "tampon," and "dental filling." I also spend a lot of time developing [**German Anki templates**](card-templates/) that are smart enough to do things like generate cloze deletions from sentences automatically and color-code nouns by gender. 

Have any ideas for a booster pack or another German Anki deck you'd like to see? I'd love to hear your suggestions at hello@monoglotanxiety.com. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy my German Anki flashcards and templates. Happy flashcarding!
