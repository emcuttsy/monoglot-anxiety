title: "Anki Decks"

Anki flashcards are one of my favorite tools for language learning and I devote a lot of time, love, and anxiety to creating flashcard decks and card templates. All those decks and templates are listed here, and a **free vocabulary list and set of basic Anki flashcards** is available for every deck.

My main flashcard project at the moment is making [**German vocabulary "booster packs"**](vocabulary-booster-packs/) of obscure, hyperspecific, taboo, slangy, or otherwise "useless" German vocabulary that you won't find on your course vocabulary list. Think things like the names of trees, 20 different words that mean drunk, and the translations of "cultist," "tampon," and "dental filling." I also spend a lot of time developing [**Anki templates**](card-templates/) that are smart enough to do things like generate cloze deletions from sentences automatically and color-code nouns by gender. 

For those of you interested in more advanced flashcardery, I also make **[complete versions](https://gumroad.com/monoglotanxiety) of my German Anki flashcards with images and example sentences for each word, cloze deletions, color-coding based on noun gender, and highlighting for irregular verb forms**. The cards are based on my reusable secret-sauce template (which automates all that color-coding and cloze-deleting). Check out the links below or visit [my webstore](https://gumroad.com/monoglotanxiety) for more info on the complete decks.

Happy flashcarding!
