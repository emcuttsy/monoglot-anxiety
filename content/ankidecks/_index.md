title: Anki German Flashcards

---
Anki flashcards are one of my favorite tools for language learning and I devote a lot of time, love, and anxiety to creating German Anki flashcards and card templates. All those free Anki decks and templates are listed here, and you can [download them for free](https://gumroad.com/monoglotanxiety) or pay-what-you want from the webstore.

Have any ideas for a German Anki deck you'd like to see? I'd love to hear your suggestions at hello@monoglotanxiety.com. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy my German Anki flashcards and templates. Happy flashcarding!
