Anki flashcards are one of my favorite tools for language learning and I devote a lot of time, love, and anxiety to creating German Anki flashcards and card templates. 

**Everything is free!** But if you want to say thanks, I wouldn't say no to a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/monoglotanxiety). 

Have any ideas for a German Anki deck you'd like to see? I'd love to hear your suggestions at hello@monoglotanxiety.com. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy my flashcards and templates. Happy flashcarding!

Everything on this is site is free. German is hard enough without having to pay to learn it. But if you do want to throw money at me for some reason, I wouldn't say no to a coffee. Thanks for visiting!
