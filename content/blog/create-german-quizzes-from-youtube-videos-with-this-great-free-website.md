Scrolling through Reddit today, I came across a great new website for German learners made by an r/German user. The site is called [Interpolly](https://www.interpolly.com/), and it allows you to easily create German vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos.

## Turn videos into German vocabulary quizzes with Interpolly

You can either choose to browse Interpolly's library of videos or provide a URL for a YouTube video to watch instead. Once the video starts, you'll see a transcript show up like subtitles underneath the video. 

If you see a word you don't know, you can click it to add it to your words list, which you can turn into quizzes that look a bit like flashcards. One clever thing I saw in the quizzes was a tendency to

You can make an account if you want to store your quizzes, but it's not necessary to sign up to use the site. 

In my experience, German-learning subreddits have been nothing but friendly and helpful. People often post amazing free learning aides and other resources that they make to help out other learners, and subs like r/German are some of my favorite places to look for new German-learning resources and tips. Interpolly was made by [u/marcellki](https://www.reddit.com/user/marcellki/). Read their post introducing it to r/German [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/lo6wsp/i_created_a_free_tool_to_turn_youtube_videos_into/).

Interpolly is still under development, and the developers would really appreciate your feedback. So the best way to support this awesome free project would be to just go and use it! There's a form on the Interpolly site where you can leave feedback. 

Here's to another awesome, free tool for German learners!

Everything on this is site is free. German is hard enough without having to pay to learn it. But if you do want to throw money at me for some reason, I wouldn't say no to a coffee. Thanks for visiting!
