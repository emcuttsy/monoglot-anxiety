I've put together what I think just might be the best German Anki deck ever.

But the real strength of this deck is **my secret-sauce German Anki card template.** It automatically color-codes nouns, highlights irregular verb forms, and generates cloze deletions from example sentences, all without extra clicks. It's what makes my deck what it is, and **you can reuse the template to make your own cards!**

 

## Features

### 1000 carefully-selected words

* Balance between nouns (499 words) and other parts of speech (501 words)
* Abstract nouns important for comprehension but often overshadowed by words for objects
* 212 adjectives, most with an opposite pair
* The 100 most frequent German verbs + 130 more that I encountered often while reading German books and news
* Most words from the popular FluentForever first 625 Base Vocabulary Word List, with important categories (e.x. family, animals, nature, occupations) expanded 
* Omits pronouns, articles, most numbers, and other super basic words you probably already know

### Media

* One image or icon representing every word
* Audio for each word and example sentence from Amazon Polly

### Reusable card template 

* Nouns color-coded by gender
* Irregular verb forms identified and highlighted
* Cloze deletion automatically generated from the example sentence

There's a free version, too. It uses the same vocabulary list as the complete deck with simple English-to-German and German-to-English cards and includes the German pronunciation for each word.
