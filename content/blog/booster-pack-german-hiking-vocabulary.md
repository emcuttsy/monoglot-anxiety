Hiking has been an escape for me since the beginning of the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once all this is over. I suppose we're at the "sanguine tourism fantasies" stage of covid-19. All that daydreaming inspired this week's booster pack of German hiking vocabulary—even though travel restrictions mean that few of us will be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!

You can download the free version of this deck of 33 words from AnkiWeb. A complete version with noun plurals, verb forms, cloze deletions, and a picture and example sentence for each word is available on my webstore for $2+ pay-what-you-want. The complete cards use my secret-sauce German Anki flashcard template to do things like automatically generate cloze deletions, color-code nouns by gender, and highlight irregular verb forms, and you can re-use the template for your own Anki cards! That's why I charge a bit of coffee change for the complete version—a lot of love and time (and anxiety) went into teaching that Anki template how German grammar works…

Hiking is a popular tourist activity in Germany, and there are a few well-known routes like the Mittelweg that are definitely on my bucket list. But interestingly, despite its [famous hilltop Disney castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle) and [alpine waterfalls so instagrammable they are *literally* to die for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHJyHCAJ-0), Germ any is mostly not a mountain country.

Germany's topography is about a 50/50 split between flat, lowlying country to the north and higher hills and plateus to the south (this is interestingly also where the High/Low German division in linguistics comes from: High German dialects were literally higher in altitude than Low German dialects). Most people live in the flat lowlands in the north. 

There are a few ranges in the interior of the country and in the southwest, and mountains extending into Saxony from the Czech border in the east.  But when it comes to the German Alps—they start to rise just about where Austria begins. Most of those beautiful pictures of mountain lakes and valleys in Germany are from the fringes of the Alps that extend into Bavaria from across the southeast border to Austria. Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, actually lies *on* the Austrian border and is divided between the two countries at its western summit. That must have been complicated pre-Schengen… the summit border wasn't opened until 1995.

*The alps begin about where Germany ends.*

Still, I used to think of Germany as a mountain country. All my stereotypes generally went something along the lines of beer, lederhosen, little hats with feathers, and mountains. As I have now been helpfully informed by Clemens, that is actually a mostly *Austrian* stereotype. Or at least he'd have me believe. Sometimes I feel like he's a bit like Chekov from those old Star Trek episodes claiming everything good in the universe was invented in Russia, except with him it's Austria.

This misconception reminds me of how everyone thinks Denmark will look like Scandinavia when in reality it looks like the Netherlands. More flat, idyllic countryside and painted cottages than dramatic fjords, snow-capped mountains, and forests haunted by the ghosts of long-dead Vikings. A German friend of mine actually showed up for her study abroad in Denmark with skis… needless to say, the skis ended up going home to Munich within a few months.

A quick Anki note: there's a good deal of overlap in hiking vocabulary and vocabulary related to nature generally and outdoor sports, and that means  of these words might show up in multiple decks I post here. Anki doesn't like duplicate cards, so if you do end up downloading a second copy of a card, I reccomend that you consolidate the duplicates. I'll write a post soon about how to handle this. 

So, with that out of the way: German hiking vocabulary! I hope you enjoy, and let me know in the comments if you liked this deck, if I missed anything, or if you have suggestions for booster packs in the future.
