Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we're at the "sanguine tourism fantasies" stage of covid-19…  Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this booster pack of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won't be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!

You can [download the free version](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/687879107) of this deck of 33 words from AnkiWeb. A [complete version with noun plurals, verb forms, cloze deletions, and a picture and example sentence for each word](https://gum.co/gZoYc) is available on my webstore for $2+ pay-what-you-want. The complete cards use my secret-sauce German Anki flashcard template to do things like automatically generate cloze deletions, color-code nouns by gender, and highlight irregular verb forms, and you can re-use the template for your own Anki cards! That's why I charge a bit of coffee change for the complete version—a lot of love and time (and anxiety) went into teaching that Anki template how German grammar works…

Unlike [my last booster pack, which consisted entirely of different German words for drunk](/blog/booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/), this deck contains vocabulary whose use I can actually endorese. 

## Most hikes in Germany aren't as alpine as you imagine

Hiking is a a very popular tourist attraction in Germany, and there are a few well-known routes like the Mittelweg that are definitely on my bucket list. I think a lot of us think of mountains when we think of Germany—of dark, hilly forests and prestine lakes flanked by snowy peaks. Which is why you might be surprsied to learn that, despite its [famous hilltop Disney castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle) and [alpine waterfalls so instagrammable they are *literally* to die for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHJyHCAJ-0), Germany is mostly not a mountain country.

Germany's topography is about a 50/50 split between flat, lowlying country to the north and higher hills and plateus to the south (this is interestingly also where the High/Low German division in linguistics comes from: High German dialects were literally higher in altitude than Low German dialects). Most people live in the flat lowlands in the north. 

There are of course mountains in Germany, namely a few ranges in the interior of the country and in the southwest, and mountains extending into Saxony from the Czech border in the east. The latter are actually pretty impressive, and sometimes get called "Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland." But when it comes to the German Alps… they start to rise just about where Austria begins. Most of those beautiful pictures of mountain lakes and valleys in Germany are from the fringes of the Alps that extend into Bavaria from across the southeast border to Austria. Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, actually lies *on* the Austrian border and is divided between the two countries at its western summit. That must have been complicated pre-Schengen… the summit border wasn't opened until 1995.

*The alps begin about where Germany ends.*

I learned all this while living in Denmark, an even more mountain-less country where people expect even more mountains. Denmark looks more like the Netherlands than it does Scandinavia—more flat, idyllic countryside and painted cottages than dramatic fjords, snow-capped mountains, and forests haunted by the ghosts of long-dead Vikings. A German friend of mine actually showed up for her study abroad in Denmark with skis… needless to say, the skis ended up going home to Munich within a few months.

Similarly, my stereotypes of Germany generally went something along the lines of beer, lederhosen, little hats with feathers, and *mountains*. As I have now been helpfully informed by my boyfriend (who is Austrian and provided the Austrian usage notes for [the "drunk" booster pack](booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/)), that is actually a mostly *Austrian* stereotype. So I guess… Germany just pulled off a really good marketing campaign when it comes to alpine tourism, successfully convincing foreign tourists that mostly Austrian and Swiss mountain imagery is quintessentially German.

…Or at least so my *completely* unbiased source would have me believe. Really, sometimes I feel like he's a bit like Chekov from those old Star Trek episodes claiming everything good in the universe was invented in Russia, except with him it's Austria.

Ahem. Anyways, that's it for this week's booster pack preamble. On with the German hiking vocabulary! I hope you enjoy, and let me know in the comments if you liked this deck, if I missed anything, or if you have suggestions for booster packs in the future. 

Ah, and a quick Anki note: there's a good deal of overlap in hiking vocabulary and vocabulary related to nature generally and outdoor sports, and that means  of these words might show up in multiple decks I post here. Anki doesn't like duplicate cards, so if you do end up downloading a second copy of a card, I reccomend that you consolidate the duplicates. I'll write a post soon about how to handle this.
