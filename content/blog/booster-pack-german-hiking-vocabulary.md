Given covid-19 related travel restrictions, not too many people who don't already live near the Alps are going to be able to visit anytime soon. At least this month's booster pack will upgrade your pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity.

Hiking is a popular tourist activity in Germany, and there are a few well-known routes like the Mittelweg that are definitely on my list to do someday. But interestingly, despite its [famous hilltop Disney castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle) and [alpine waterfalls so instagrammable they are *literally* to die for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHJyHCAJ-0), Germany is mostly not a mountain country.

Germany's topography is about a 50/50 split between flat, lowlying country to the north and higher hills and plateus to the south (this is interestingly also where the High/Low German division in linguistics comes from: High German dialects were literally higher in altitude than Low German dialects). Most people live in the flat lowlands in the north. 

There are a few ranges in the interior of the country and in the southwest, and mountains extending into Saxony from the Czech border in the east.  But when it comes to the German Alps—they start to rise just about where Austria begins. Most of those beautiful pictures of mountain lakes and valleys in Germany are from the fringes of the Alps that extend into Bavaria from across the southeast border to Austria. Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, actually lies *on* the Austrian border and is divided between the two countries at its western summit. That must have been complicated pre-Schengen… the summit border wasn't opened until 1995.

*The alps begin about where Germany ends.*

Still, I used to think of Germany as a mountain country. All my stereotypes generally went something along the lines of beer, lederhosen, little hats with feathers, and mountains. As I have now been helpfully informed by Clemens, that is actually a mostly *Austrian* stereotype. Or at least he'd have me believe. Sometimes I feel like he's a bit like Chekov from those old Star Trek episodes claiming everything good in the universe was invented in Russia, except with him it's Austria.
