Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole "*Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache*" idea. And I've noticed that many of the words that most often initiate a holy-$h!#-what-case-do-I-use death-spiral are the common verbs describing speech: *sagen*, *fragen*, and co. 

The funny thing is, these verbs actually *mostly*–and I'll'get to the *mostly* bit–behave according to the usual rules dictating case in German. Maybe I'm getting this wrong all the time because I'm over-correcting for the apparent randomness of other common German verbs… or maybe I just never learned these properly. Either way, you can easily avoid making the mistakes I made just by taking a second to peek at the grammar of these common verbs.

## How *not* to do it

Yesterday I got myself confused about again this during a lesson with my iTalki tutor. We were going over a practice text I had written about a shy girl getting drunk at her friend's birthday party (what a topic) and my tutor pointed out the following mistake in my writing:

> "Alle meine Freunde haben \*mich <u>gefragt</u>, warum ich dich ihnen nich früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich \*sie <u>erzählt</u> habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag." 

In both of the mistakes, I use the wrong case for the "listener" receiving speech described by the underlined verb. The correct way to write this would be:

> "Alle meine Freunde haben **mir** gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nicht früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich **ihnen** erzählt habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag."

Let's break down how I screwed up.

## The person being spoken to is usually in the dative case

With the vast majority of German verbs for speech, the "listener" is in the **dative** case. Most of the time, this is because the verb is following German's usual rules, but there are a few that just need to be memorized.

Often, the listener is in the dative case because they are the *indirect object* of the verb. In a sentence, they "receive" whatever is spoken–an accusative direct object–from the speaker. Verbs that are used this way include **sagen (to say), erzhälen (to tell), erklären (to explain),** and **befehlen (to order)**. 

These verbs always take a dative listener—even if the accusative direct object is omitted. For instance:

Ich sagte <u>ihm</u> die Geschichte.<br>
*I told him the sory.*

Ich sagte <u>ihm</u>.<br>
*I told him.*

Other common verbs describing speech that also "follow the rules" take dative listeners because they are used *mit*, which forces the following noun into the dative. These verbs include **reden mit (to converse), sprechen mit (to speak),** and **mitteilen (to share with)**.

So these words aren't irregular at all when it comes to case. They follow the usual rule stating that the direct object is in the accusative and the indirect object is in the dative.

But there are a few sneaky ones that don't (or almost never) take indirect objects and don't use "mit," but which still take dative listeners. And some of these are quite common, so they're worth remembering: **danken (to thank), gratulieren (to congratulate), verzeihen (to apologize), entgegnen (to counter/retort),** and **widersprechen (to contradict/refuse**). Since these verbs don't take direct objects, it's common to see them followed by a subordinate clause beginning with "dass," which explains why the thanking, congratulating, apologizing, etc. occurred. For instance: 

Ich danke <u>dir</u>, dass du meinen Blogeintrag gelesen hast.<br>
*Thank you for reading my blog post.*

## But *fragen* and *bitten* take the accusative

Luckily, there aren't very many speech verbs that break pattern and use the accusative case for the person being spoken: among the common verbs, **fragen (to ask)** and **bitten (to request)** are the only ones. Even beyond just the context of describing speech, these verbs are pretty unusual. They number among only a handful of German verbs that can take *two* accusative objects.

This is one of those things you should just memorize. But one way I've tried to get myself to "feel" the accusative here is to think about more aggressive forms of questioning. Just think of how it feels when you're questioned "at" rather than asked "of." For a more concrete example, just imagine an interrogation scene from one of those network crime shows that never seems to run out of seasons—lots of questions are asked, most of them pretty "accusative."

And in case you're still wondering why I wrote that practice story about someone getting drunk at a party, the answer is that my awesome tutor had given me just about the most hilarious writing prompt ever: 

*There are a lot of words for 'drunk' in German. Find as many as you can, and then write a story in which the main character is drunk.*

All those words for "drunk" are coming up in another post. Cheers! :beers:
