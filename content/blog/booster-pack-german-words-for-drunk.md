Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that **there are a *lot* of words that mean "drunk" in German.** This post walks through more than 20 of them, and I've also put them together as a neat set of [**Anki cards with every variation of "tipsy" and "smashed" you could ever want**](https://gumroad.com/monoglotanxiety) that's available for pay-what-you-want (so probably free).

Given that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beer—so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor's Travel forum: [can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?"](https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/can-a-non-beer-drinker-visit-germany-207858/) Is it even *possible*? 

The answer, by the way, is no. I'm not so into beer myself, and I tried to make a dry visit once. But the border checkpoint guy won't let you through unless you finish off a full liter of beer (but not French beer) in front of him. Extra points if you drink it out of a boot. 

So you'll *definitely* need these words…

Jokes aside, if you do ever end up drunk in germanophone company and decide to flex your language skills, you can get by just fine with *betrunken* alone. An extensive list of synonyms is probably the last thing you'll remember when these words becomes relevant, anyaways. But at least you'll be well prepared to explain yourself the next day!

## 20 German words for drunk, but with \*nuance\*

While all of these words mean "drunk," they aren't all equivalent. Many are slang or colloquialisms. And just like in English, there are different words for each step along the way from a good night to a bad one—words that might be translated better as "buzzed," "tipsy," or "smashed." 

This non-exhaustive but extensive list is categorized from least-drunk to most-drunk and includes information on register when relevant. I had my boyfriend check these over, but he's Austrian so if a German tells you something's funny here I blame his amazing but nonstandard dialect. *Prost!*

### a few beers - from buzzed to tipsy

* angetrunken - buzzed, just a little drunk
* angeheitert - [colloq.] buzzed, just a little drunk
* beschickert - [colloq.] tipsy
* beschwipst - [colloq.] tipsy, drunk enough to be boisterous and a little wild
* benebelt - befuddled, drunk enough to be confused

### beer - officially drunk

* alkoholisiert - intoxicated
* betrunken - drunk
* berauscht - [formal] inebriated, intoxicated, drunk
* blau - [colloq.] drunk. Variations include the humorous/joking colloquialisms *blitzblau* and *veilchenblau* and slang *kornblumenblau*
* dicht - [slang] drunk or high

### too much beer - sloshed, wasted

## About "booster packs"

I worked part-time in a board game shop a few summers ago, and like many board game shops this one made most of its income selling Magic the Gathering booster packs. While you might not *need* them to play the game, booster packs what make it fun (or addictive?). 

Learning vocabulary isn't so different. You can get by with just the necessary words and should definitely focus on high-frequency vocabulary to start. **But its the unnecessary words that make learning the necessary ones worth it.** 

The idea behind these vocabulary booster packs is to compile words that you wouldn't usually find in vocabulary list but that are fun, important in certain specific contexts, or actually useful but too charged or taboo for a typical German course to cover—think words like "tampon" or "mangrove."

I make these booster packs into Anki decks available for pay-what-you-want—you can download them for free if you want. Each word also has an image and example sentence and appears on three cards: English to German, German to English, cloze deletion based on the example sentence.
