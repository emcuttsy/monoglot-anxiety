If you're a language nerd like me, you probably waste hours reading books _about_ languages that you could have spent actually _learning_ one.  And now you're reading a review _about_ a book _about_ language learning instead of actually learning a language. So it goes.

Anyhow, this is my first book review for the blog. Let me know what you like — and especially what you _don't_ like — so the next one can be better.

**_Note: I was given a free ebook copy of_ The Language Secret _by its author for review._**

## _The Language Secret_ by John Stedman

The subtitle of the book is "How to speak 10 languages badly"and if that's your goal (and if those 10 languages are Romance and Germanic languages), you will find a lot to love in _The Language Secret_. Experienced language learners and language lovers will find lots of "ah hah!" moments in Stedman's book, especially in the chapters about language families. 

However, the book misses the mark with its purported target audience—anglophone monoglots learning their first new language. The main takeaways get buried under jokes and pop-culture references and actionable "do this, not that, then do this" instructions are few and far between.

{{<notice note "The Language Secret by John Stedman">}}

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

**Price**: $9.99 (Kindle), $19.99 (Paperback), $29.99 (Hardcover)

**TLDR:** Outstanding for #langtwt types trying to learn 15 languages, but I wouldn't give it to my monolingual mom who just wants to learn Italian

**The good:**

* Thoroughly anti-perfectionist
* Lots of lightbulb moments for experienced learners
* Sections on the Romance and Germanic languages useful for anglophones who want to learn multiple languages at once

**The bad:**

* Often lacks of clear, actionable instructions
* Takeaways sometimes buried under references and quips
* Recommended vocabulary learning technique requires a partner

**The ugly:**

* Rambling introductions drove me insane. But that's just me.

## What is "The Language Secret" anyways?

The eponymous "Language Secret" of _The Language Secret_ is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.

I think this is a good secret — an anti-perfectionism mantra I'm going to keep in my subconscious back-pocket for all future perfectionist meltdowns. If you're the kind of person who keeps perfectly calligraphed bullet journals and actually uses Toggl, I suspect this secret will be especially useful for you. If fear of making mistakes holds you back from trying to use your target language, this book will be worth it for you even if you take nothing else from it. 

> The eponymous "language secret" of _The Language Secret_ is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.

The fact is, _most adult learners will never achieve native-like fluency_ ([Lightbown 2000](https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/21.4.431)). If you need to be able to achieve perfect mastery over something to find it fulfilling, language learning is not for you. Find a hobby you can master, like solving Rubik's cubes.

So, if it's unusual — read: vanishingly rare — for adult language learners to achieve native-like fluency in a new language, there is _no_ chance that you will speak well when you start out. **Stedman's anti-perfectionist "language secret" is some of the best language learning advice you could ask for.**

### But... should you really _speak_ badly?

With its call to "speak badly" and specific advice aimed at starting to speak as quickly as possible — including knowingly ignoring grammar and relying on easier-to-learn, but incorrect work-arounds — _The Language Secret_ falls firmly into the speak-from-day-one [á la Benny Lewis](https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/) camp.

But I'm not convinced that very early speaking is helpful—or even that it isn't _harmful_. 

I didn't start speaking German _badly_, at least not in the way Stedman suggests, in a sort of "me, Tarzan" way.  After about a year of soaking in comprehensible input, I started speaking at about a B1 level. Because of this, I never had the chance to develop bad habits at A1 that could follow me to B1.

Still, the existence of a true "silent period" in 2nd language acquisition by children isn't even settled in the research yet, let alone in language-learning adults ([Roberts 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.09.001)). And at the end of the day, Stedman is the polyglot, not I. Go forth and speak badly if that's what you want to do. 

## "Ah-hah" moments for experienced learners

Beyond its refreshing anti-perfectionism, Stedman's book really shines as a soft intro to many of the more technical ideas that underpin language learning. For experienced learners who haven't already encountered these ideas, _The Language Secret_ will set off lightbulbs left and right.

This is especially true if you're studying or have ever studied a Germanic or Romance language. The two chapters on these language families pull back the curtain on some interesting patterns that provide a "why" for many of the major patterns and quirks of these popular languages.

But even if you're studying Russian or Thai, the sections on grammar, idiom, register, and language families in general will all offer helpful insights. Anglophones, in particular, will benefit from the chapter on grammar which points out many of the patterns in English that tend to break down in other languages. 

### If you like learning a little bit of lots of languages, this book is for you

I see a lot of people interested in many, many languages in the language learning corners of the internet. Look at people's Twitter bios and you'll see 15 different flags indicating their target languages. 

If that sounds like you, _The Language Secret_ can probably help you achieve that rough understanding of many languages that you're aiming for. The chapters on language families are intended to show how you can acquire basic vocabulary and grammar in many sister languages at once. 

## Not the best book for first-time learners

While I think experienced (and perhaps very motivated) learners can get a lot out of _The Language Secret_, I would _not_ recommend this book to beginners.

The alternate title of the book is "How to speak 10 languages badly." If that's what you want, read the book. If you're a monoglot just trying to learn Spanish, I suspect that you might leave Stedman's tome a bit more confused than you came into it. 

### The important points get buried under excessive quips and references

Unfortunately, _The Language Secret_ buries most of its helpful points under a heap of unnecessary verbiage and indulgent references to pop-culture and history. And instead of providing clear instructions or highlighting the main points succinctly, it waxes sarcastic to indulge in line upon line of what I can only describe as very British humor. To get a sense of what I'm talking about, look at the chapter titles in the[ ](/#chapter-breakdown)[next]()[ section](www.monoglotanxiety.com/post/book-review-the-language-secret#chapter-breakdown). 

This, in my view, makes the book almost unusable for beginners. 

If you already have an idea of how to learn a language, the quips and random references might just be fun icing on information you can take and incorporate into your existing learning practices. But for total newbies, the book does not offer clear enough directions. Information is provided, but the "so what" is often missing. 

Each chapter begins with few (ebook) pages devoted to a story that is in most cases only tangentially related to the topics at hand. References to that story will then show up over, and over, and over again throughout the chapter — alongside new references to other things that you may or may not have ever heard of before or care about. 

Perhaps it's my journalism experience ("Don't bury the lede!"), but I found the references and extremely quippy tone excessive. And irritating. Especially because reference-laden quips take the place of bullet-points with the main takeaways at the end of each chapter.

### Suggested learning methods can be a tad out of touch

My final bone to pick with _The Language Secret_ is that the few specific methods it does suggest are often a bit out of touch.

The book doesn't seem to recognize that digital tools other than Google Translate and Duolingo exist. The section on spaced repetition doesn't even mention Anki, Memrise, or any of the other popular spaced repetition programs. 

Instead of introducing Anki, _The Language Secret_ suggests that you make paper flashcards and have a friend (in practice, I assume, romantic partner) drill you on them. The method outlined wouldn't be possible to do on your own. You _need_ that friend to pronounce things for you. 

For pronunciation, the book doesn't suggest shadowing or comprehensible input or even much listening — it suggests using the IPA. That's fine, but I can't remember the book specifying _how_ exactly one should use the IPA to learn pronunciation. 

As a final point, one strategy suggested was learning vocabulary while squeezing a ball or doing some other task with your non-dominant hand. This was motivated by some left-brain-right-brain stuff and ultimately didn't make logical sense — not just because that whole left-brain-right-brain thing is kinda hokey, but also because it was predicated on the left side of the body being tied to the left side of the brain, which is is wrong. The right side of the body is controlled by the left side of the brain. 

## Chapter breakdown

_The Language Secret_ is divided into an introduction, conclusion, and 10 chapters. Below are quick breakdowns of each of the 10 chapters. 

A note: I've introduced each chapter under my own "translated" titles. The real chapter titles always consist of title, a subtitle, and a sub-subtitle. Yes, a _sub_-subtitle. As mentioned above, over-writing like this is one of the biggest problems with _The Language Secret._

## Conclusion

For all of my frustration with this book's tone and my recommendation that first-time learners skip it, _The Language Secret_ is still a solid language learning guide for experienced learners. Instead of focusing on the practical specifics of language learning, it zooms out to offer an overview of many of the important concepts underpinning language and language learning, especially language families. Pick it up if you want to learn multiple languages and can handle a bit of rambling. 

And remember the "language secret" — to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly!
