Quippy intro

**_Note: I was given a free ebook copy of_ The Language Secret _by its author for review._**

## _The Language Secret_ by John Stedman

The subtitle of the book is "How to speak 10 languages badly"and if that's your goal (and if those 10 languages are Romance and Germanic languages), this is the book for you. Experienced language learners and language lovers will find lots of "ah hah!" moments in Stedman's book, especially in the chapters about language families. 

However, _The Language Secret_ misses the mark with its purported target audience—anglophone monoglots learning their first new language. The main takeaways get buried under jokes and pop-culture references and actionable "do this, not that, then do this" instructions are few and far between.

{{<notice note "The Language Secret by John Stedman">}}

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

**Price**: $9.99 (Kindle), $19.99 (Paperback), $29.99 (Hardcover)

**TLDR:** Great for #langtwt types trying to learn 200 languages, but I wouldn't give it to my monolingual mom who just wants to learn Italian

**The good:**

* Thoroughly anti-perfectionist
* Lots of lightbulb moments for experienced learners
* Sections on the Romance and Germanic languages useful for anglophones who want to learn multiple languages at once
* Not afraid to admit that it was written with English-speakers in mind

**The bad:**

* Often lacks of clear, actionable instructions
* Takeaways sometimes buried under references and quips
* Recommended vocabulary learning technique requires a partner

**The ugly:**

* Rambling introductions drove me insane. But that's just me.

## What is "The Language Secret" anyways?

I will admit, I didn't realize this the first time I read the book. The "Language Secret" itself is presented at the end of the introduction and in the final chapter. But I lost track of it through the book.

## "Ah-hah" moments for experienced learners

## Excessive verbosity buries the useful points

## Chapter breakdown

_The Language Secret_ is divided into an introduction, conclusion, and 10 chapters. Below are quick breakdowns of each of the 10 chapters. 

A note: I've introduced each chapter under my own "translated" titles. The real chapter titles always consist of title, a subtitle, and a sub-subtitle. Yes, a _sub_-subtitle. Excessive verbosity is one of my biggest problems with _The Language Secret._
