Quippy intro

**_Note: I was given a free ebook copy of_ The Language Secret _by its author for review._**

## _The Language Secret_ by John Stedman

The subtitle of the book is "How to speak 10 languages badly"and if that's your goal (and if those 10 languages are Romance and Germanic languages), this is the book for you. Experienced language learners and language lovers will find lots of "ah hah!" moments in Stedman's book, especially in the chapters about language families. 

However, _The Language Secret_ misses the mark with its purported target audience—anglophone monoglots learning their first new language. The main takeaways get buried under jokes and pop-culture references and actionable "do this, not that, then do this" instructions are few and far between.

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

**Price**: $9.99 (Kindle), $19.99 (Paperback), $29.99 (Hardcover)

**TLDR:** Great for #langtwt types trying to learn 200 languages, but I wouldn't give it to my monolingual mom who just wants to learn Italian

**The good:**

* Thoroughly anti-perfectionist
* Lots of lightbulb moments for experienced learners
* Sections on the Romance and Germanic languages useful for anglophones who want to learn multiple languages at once
* Not afraid to admit that it was written with English-speakers in mind

**The bad:**

* Often lacks of clear, actionable instructions
* Takeaways sometimes buried under references and quips
* Recommended vocabulary learning technique requires a partner

**The ugly:**

* Rambling introductions drove me insane. But that's just me.

## Chapter breakdown

_The Language Secret_ is divided into 10 chapters, each with an (in my opinion) far-too-long name that buries the point. Here are my translations 

1.  **The 4 Major Language Skills: Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing   
   **("The Birmingham Screwdriver: In Which We Find Out How To Get Started and Use The Right Tools for the Job: What Is Involved in Learning a Language and How Long It Takes")
2. 

## Use language families to learn multiple languages at once

## Why don't I recommend this book for 1st-time learners?
