I didn't book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German.

My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate level (about B1 for you CEFR people).

I used to think that it'd be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner. Why pay to talk to someone in your target language if you're not ready to actually _talk_ yet?

I previously tried taking a few lessons in Spanish and Danish, two languages I'm not confident speaking in, but wasn't convinced they were any more helpful than watching target language TV.

But recently, I started taking lessons in Italian, a language in which I'm about A1 and definitely can't communicate effectively. And working with my stellar Italian tutor completely changed my mind: `{{<`**`highlight`** `html >}}`It _can_ be worth it to work with a tutor as a total beginner — you just need to find the right teacher. `{{< /`**`highlight`**` >}}`

Because I already had a functional understanding of the language, I didn't need a teacher prepared to sit down and walk me through the basics. That meant I could opt for more affordable conversation practice lessons with tutors who weren't certified teachers. And because I could speak German throughout the whole lesson none of the lesson was "wasted" on explanations in English.
