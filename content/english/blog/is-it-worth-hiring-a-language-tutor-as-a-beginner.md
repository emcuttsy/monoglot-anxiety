I didn't book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate level (about B1 for you CEFR people).

I used to think that it'd be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner. For me, working with tutors was always about practicing speech — the only language skill I couldn't learn alone. And why pay to talk to someone in your target language if you're not ready to actually _talk_ yet?

The few lessons I've taken in Spanish and Danish, two languages I'm not confident speaking in, didn't convince me they were any more helpful than watching target language TV. But recently, I started taking lessons in Italian,  And working with my stellar Italian tutor completely changed my mind:

**It _can_ be worth it to work with a tutor as a total beginner —  if you find the right teacher.**

## Why wait to hire a tutor?

If you poll the language learning community, you'll hear a range of opinions on whether tutors are worth it at the beginning (or at all). Waiting to start lessons worked well for me, and there certainly are good reasons to wait on hiring a language tutor until you reach an intermediate level. 

First, **informal conversation lessons are generally cheaper than lessons for beginners**. It takes more work and time to design lessons suitable for true beginners in a new language. Starting at an intermediate level means that you can opt for informal conversation-based classes, which are often cheaper. 

Likewise, **finding a tutor as a beginner is likely to be more expensive**. Community tutors — tutors who are not certified second-language teachers — on sites like iTalki often only offer informal conversation courses for intermediate and advanced students (some do teach beginners, though). Tutors who are confident guiding beginners from 0 to A1 are often certified teachers and therefore more expensive. 

**Many of the things you need to learn as a beginner are easy to teach yourself for free**, anyways. You can save yourself a nice chunk of cash by teaching yourself the basics.

And finally — and perhaps most controversially — **starting to speak too early might not be a great idea**.

### Is a silent period important for adult learners?

When we  The science seems to be mixed here.

## The right tutor for a beginner might not be best at 

The best tutor for you is not necessarily the best tutor for someone else — and the language learner you are now is not the same as the language learner you'll be in a year.
