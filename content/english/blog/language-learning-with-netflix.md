## Netflix is one of my favorite language-learning tools

TV series are a great resource for language learners. And it's never been easier to access fantastic content other languages thanks to streaming services like Netflix.

It may be a bit weird to think of streaming services (which absolutely weren't designed with language learners in mind) as "language learning equipment," but they really are â€” they were for me, at least. I was learning German from Netflix before I had even consciously decided to start learning German... 

I'm no outlier: watching TV really _does_ help with language learning. Anecdotally, I can report that just about every Dane I talked to while living in Denmark credited _South Park_ for their (often perfectly fluent and almost accent-free) English. And more concretely, there's real research showing that [comprehensible input](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/what-is-comprehensible-input-language-learning/) is necessary for language acquisition.

In this post, I explain how you can learn languages with Netflix, explain why watching TV for language learning works, and share how I used Netflix to [teach myself German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/).
