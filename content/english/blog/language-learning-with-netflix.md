## Netflix is one of my favorite language-learning tools

TV series are a great resource for language learners. And the good news is that it's never been easier to access fantastic content other languages thanks to streaming services like Netflix (even if location restrictions can get in the wayðŸ«¤).

And yes, watching TV is a perfectly valid language learning strategy. Anecdotally, I can report that just about every Dane I talked to while living in Denmark credited _South Park_ for their (often perfectly fluent and almost accent-free) English. And more concretely, there's real research showing that [comprehensible input](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/what-is-comprehensible-input-language-learning/) is necessary for language acquisition.

In this post, I explain how you can learn languages with Netflix, explain why watching TV for language learning works, and share how I used Netflix to [teach myself German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/).
