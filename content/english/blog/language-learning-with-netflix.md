## Netflix is one of my favorite language-learning tools

TV series are a great resource for language learners. And it's never been easier to access fantastic content other languages thanks to streaming services like Netflix.

It may be a bit weird to think of streaming services (which absolutely weren't designed with language learners in mind) as "language learning equipment," but they really are — they were for me, at least. I was learning German from Netflix before I had even consciously decided to start learning German... 

I'm no outlier: watching TV really _does_ help with language learning. Anecdotally, I can report that just about every Dane I talked to while living in Denmark credited _South Park_ for their (often perfectly fluent and almost accent-free) English. And more concretely, there's real research showing that [comprehensible input](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/what-is-comprehensible-input-language-learning/) is necessary for language acquisition.

In this post, I explain how you can learn languages with Netflix, explain why watching TV for language learning works, and share how I used Netflix to [teach myself German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/).

## How to learn languages with Netflix

However, there are some things to keeping in mind when using Netflix for language learning:

### Finding the best series for language learning

### Is it okay to watch dubs?

### Netflix language learning extension 

Not all 

## Why it works: comprehensible input

### Research shows comprehensible input works

### Other examples of comprehensible input

Watching TV is obviously not the only way to get comprehensible input. _Anything_ in your target language that you can understand well enough to stay engaged in is comprehensible input — so the possibilities are really only as limited as your media diet.

* **Video:** Twitch streams, YouTube, series, movies, vlogs, language apps like Lingopie and Lingq
* **Audio:** Podcasts, audiobooks, music, language apps with an audio-only mode like Glossika
* **Text:** Books, newspapers, magazines, blogs, articles, graded readers, websites/forums, language apps like Beelingual and Duolingo's stories
* **Conversation:** Tutors, language exchange, friends and family, (and, if you're a high level extrovert, strangers) 

## How I learn languages with Netflix

### Re-watching old favorites makes things easier as a beginner

### Accepting the absurdity of watching dubs of shows originally in my native language

### Watching authentic shows and movies to build a connection to the language

### Not letting perfect get in the way of good enough

I don't do any special extra studying when I watch TV series for language learning. That's right: no flashcards, no notes, nothing. I just sit back and watch.
