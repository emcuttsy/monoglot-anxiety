## My first Italian exchange and my first attempt at reading in Italian

Italian continues to be a joy — hearing it just immediately brightens my mood in such a delightful way. Even if I don't end up reaching my goal of B2 in Italian, I'll still be so happy to have spent some time with this lovely language. 

This week I met with an Italian language exchange partner for the first time despite not speaking much Italian at all because... why not? I thought I'd give it a go

## German this week was basically just watching the dub of _Roman Empire_

Last month's major victory — convincing my partner to watch Netflix's _Dark_ with me in German — has snowballed into an even bigger victory. He's now watching German dubs with me! 

Clemens _hates_ dubs, which is maybe one of the reasons his English is so fluent. He's resisted watching them with me in the past (and I admit, they're often not as _good_ as the originals, whatever language the original was in), but I think that seeing how motivated I am to actually get good at his language has finally swayed him. We watched through the German dub of _Roman Empire_ on Netflix this last week and while the German narrator was no Sean Bean, the dub was fine. A bit weird at times, but fine. The dub actors for Caesar and Marc Antony were especially good.

## How early should you start language exchange?

Following my gut and deciding to focus on Italian even though I have some solid reasons for learning Spanish was tough. And making the switch got me thinking: since I'm learning multiple languages, how _should_ I decide which ones to focus on at any given point? When is it okay to switch?

Of course, there's a bit more to it than that. It's true that hopping around too frequently can mean you end up dabbling in a lot of languages but never learning any of them to the standards _you set for yourself_ (read that again!). As a solution to this problem, I'm trying out a strategy of making short-term commitments with end-dates. The idea is that this will allow me to make a satisfying chunk of progress while still leaving room to respond to my motivation and current situation.

### Do adults need a silent period?

I took Mandarin courses in middle school. Back then, I was enthralled by the language and couldn't imagine ever abandoning it. Fast-forward 10 years and I can think of 15 languages I'd rather learn before Mandarin.

Should I force myself to learn it anyways? After all, I took 2 years of Mandarin when I was a preteen, and I promised myself I'd learn the language back then. It was a goal! I need to follow through!

... ridiculous, right?

Goals change. Life changes. It's great to have some vision for the future, but priorities shift and we need to be real about that.

Spanish is appealing to me mostly for three reasons: language aesthetics, size of native speaker community, and the fact that I used to be okay at it in high school.

Ok, I'm also into Spanish because of the existence of Borges. 3.5 reasons.

Until recently, those 3.5 reasons kept me more motivated for Spanish than for Italian. But my situation has changed and now there are some reasons it makes sense for me to focus on Italian instead.

First, I'm moving to Austria soon. There's a lot of Austro-Italo exchange since Austria borders Italy, and I can easily imagine spending time in Italy since it'll be so close by. Second, my mom recently decided that she may want to retire in Italy. If she actually wants to do that, me learning Italian could make a huge difference when it comes to making that dream actually possible.

I really value learning languages that I think I'll actually use, so these two factors really pushed my motivation for Italian beyond my motivation for Spanish. Finding an incredible tutor, discovering that Italian just _sounds_ awesome, and finding some really great beginners resources just threw a cherry on top.

Switching to Italian was a response to my _current_ situation — including soft factors like motivation. And I think we should always choose languages to learn based on where we are _now_ rather than where when we set goals in the past.

Taking a break is fine. Your other target languages aren't going anywhere... unless they are. Keeping track of your "current situation" also includes making the best of time-limited special opportunities to learn one of your target languages like being in the country or taking a university course. Switching back to Spanish in the middle of an Italy trip might not be worth it.

### Why I like cross-talk exchange at a beginner level

So, how to actually put that rambling thought into practice?

**Committing to a subset of your target languages for a defined period — say a month or a quarter — might give you enough time to make a satisfying amount of progress without locking yourself into a language that isn't sparking your interest for too long.**

I'm doing this with Italian now. I decided to stick with it until at least the beginning of April. That's 3 months to focus on Italian, which I think should be enough to get to a point where I can understand a fair bit of what I hear in relatively straightforward authentic content — a nice point to reach even if I don't go further.  After those 3 months, I can decide if I want to go on with Italian for another chunk of time.

Writing down the plan is helping me stick with it: I noted my intention to stick with Italian until at least the beginning of April in my digital goal-setting notebook (the Notion people finally got me). I also booked lessons with a tutor through the end of my Italian study period to keep me accountable.

That's all from me for this week. How do you handle dabbling and shifting motivations? Have you tried something like the short-term commitment suggestion I outline? Let me know what you think in the comments below.

Ciao!
