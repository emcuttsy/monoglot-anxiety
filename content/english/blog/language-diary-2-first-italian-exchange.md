Welcome back to my language diary. Which is apparently biweekly now with posts appearing on either Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on how I feel.

Yes I know bloggers are supposed to be reliable, but my whole "thing" is kinda chaos so forgive me this completely in-character 2 day buffer period.

## Getting back into the swing of things

Italian continues to be a joy — hearing it immediately brightens my mood right up. Even if I don't end up reaching my goal of B2 in Italian, I'll still be so happy to have spent some time with this language.

My learning "strategy" right now, if you could call it a strategy, is to use Speakly every morning for about 10-20 minutes (\~10 new words/phrases per day) and then do whatever I feel like for an hour or two throughout the 

### My favorite Italian beginner resources so far

I'm at this delightful stage with Italian right now where everything is new and useful, and I've enjoyed exploring the numerous (and often free) beginner resources out there for this language. Here are my favorites right now:

* [**_l'Italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura_**](https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/8sj70x/litaliano_secondo_il_metodo_natura/) _—_ the bizarre graded reader/textbook hybrid I never knew I needed. It's basically a novel that starts out in sub-A1 super repetitive Italian and brings you up beyond B2, all without any English whatsoever. I read a chapter to myself out loud about every 2 days.
* [**Speakly**](https://www.speakly.me/)**.** After futzing around with Anki forever I finally switched to Speakly and love it. It's a bit like Duolingo sans the cutsey characters and memeworthy useless sentences with a very thoughtful vocabulary set. I learn at least 10 "words" (unclear what Speakly counts as a word) a day and reached the 500 "words" mark today. Speakly also offers courses in Russian, German, Spanish, French, Finnish, and Estonian for English speakers.
* [**Easy Italian**](https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyItalian)**.** I love that this YouTube channel is almost entirely in Italian — there's nothing I hate more than comprehensible input resources that switch to English all the time. They have a Super Easy Italian playlist that I've been using a lot.
* [**_Simple Italian Podcast_**](https://simonepols.com/come-imparare-litaliano/simple-italian-podcast-il-podcast-di-italiano-comprensibile/)**_._** Slow, comprehensible Italian in podcast form? Interesting topics that aren't just Italian culture? Yes please. I love to have some kind of comprehensible/slow audio running in the background when I'm doing chores or menial tasks, and this fills that niche in my Italian learning environment perfectly.

## Language learning actually requires... equipment?

Headphones

### Get yourself some wireless earbuds or headphones

#### But remember that you should probably take them off sometimes...
