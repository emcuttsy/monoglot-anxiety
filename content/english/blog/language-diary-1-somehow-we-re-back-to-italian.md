## After a detour through Spanish, I'm back to Italian and loving it

One key factor in motivating me to commit to Italian for now is my amazing tutor on iTalki. I used to think that lessons for true beginners were mostly a waste of time and money, [but my first lesson with my Italian tutor really changed my mind](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-it-worth-hiring-a-language-tutor-as-a-beginner/). A skilled teacher can definitely make a difference at the beginning — though I still wouldn't pay for casual conversation practice until I can, you know, kinda hold a casual conversation.

I've been waffling between the two sister languages since November, but I've committed to Italian until the beginning of April for now. I'll re-evaluate how I'm feeling about Spanish at that point. Long-term, my goal is to get Italian to around B1 (or wherever "conversational fluency" ends up being) and then focus on getting to that point with either Spanish or Danish depending on motivation.

What matters now, not Sunk costs.

Your other target languages aren't going anywhere — unless they are. If you have some time-limited special opportunity to get quality practice in for one of your target languages, it might make sense to stick with it until the opportunity

* usually not a problem to leaev something on maintenence. watch a video every once and a while, keep it in mind
* But if you're in the country for a short period of tm

Committing to a subset of your target languages for a defined period — say a month or a quarter — gives you time to make progress but also gives you flexi

That's all for this week. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you around the internet langosphere. Ciao ciao!
