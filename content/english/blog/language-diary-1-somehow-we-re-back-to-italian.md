I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she's doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I've been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes. 

Anyhow, you can expect to see a little update from me every week from here on. Each entry in my "language diary" here will lay out the languages I'm  working on at the moment and the resources I'm using before briefly exploring a little question I had related to language learning in the previous week.

## After a detour through Spanish, I'm back to Italian and loving it

I started dabbling in Italian in early fall, but Spanish really captured my interest in November and December and I took a detour into Spanish for a while. These days my motivation has swung a full 180 back towards Italian and Italian has been my focus for the past month or so.

One key factor in motivating me to commit to Italian for now is my amazing tutor on iTalki. I used to think that lessons for true beginners were mostly a waste of time and money, [but my first lesson with my Italian tutor really changed my mind](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-it-worth-hiring-a-language-tutor-as-a-beginner/). A skilled teacher can definitely make a difference at the beginning — though I still wouldn't pay for casual conversation practice until I can, you know, kinda hold a casual conversation.

### What about Spanish?

I'll definitely be back to Spanish — I know I won't be able to resist forever! I've been waffling between the two sister languages since November, but I've committed to Italian until the beginning of April for now. I'll re-evaluate how I'm feeling about Spanish at that point. 

Long-term, my goal is to get Italian to around B1 (or wherever "conversational fluency" ends up being) and then focus on getting to that point with either Spanish or Danish depending on motivation.

## Continuing to plink along with German

With German it's been all B2 business as usual: chatting with a speaking partner at least once a week, using Speakly (10 words/day), writing to penpals, and consuming as much native content as I can. I'm very motivated for Italian at the moment, and I've noticed that all the Italian input I've been consuming is carving out chunks of time and attention I'd usually siphon into  German.

A major victory in the last few weeks was _finally_ convincing my (German-speaking) boyfriend to watch Netflix's _Dark_ with me in German, which over all 3 seasons was around 28 hours of input. Not bad. I'm also speaking more German with him at home lately, which has been a nice little shift.  

## How should you choose which of your target languages to focus on?

Following my gut and deciding to focus on Italian even though I have some solid reasons for learning Spanish was tough. Making the switch got me thinking: since I'm learning multiple languages, how _should_ I decide which ones to focus on at any given point? When is it okay to switch?

The short answer: Switching is always okay. Life is not a contract signed in blood that a demon is going to show up to enforce every time you stray from your original plans.

Of course, there's a bit more to it than that. It's true that hopping around too frequently can mean you end up dabbling in a lot of languages but never learning any of them to the standards _you set for yourself_ (read that again!). As a solution to this problem, I'm trying out a strategy of making short-term commitments with end-dates. The idea is that this will allow me to make a satisfying chunk of progress while still leaving room to respond to my motivation and current situation.

### Think about what makes sense _now_

What matters now, not Sunk costs.

Your other target languages aren't going anywhere — unless they are. If you have some time-limited special opportunity to get quality practice in for one of your target languages, it might make sense to stick with it until the opportunity

* But if you're in the country for a short period of tm

### Make a short-term commitment and know when your next chance to switch is coming

Committing to a subset of your target languages for a defined period — say a month or a quarter — gives you time to make progress but also gives you flexi

That's all for this week. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you around the internet langosphere. Ciao ciao!
