Spanish was my best subject in high school. I aced my Spanish courses for four years. And yet still can't really speak any Spanish at all.

Meanwhile, after 3 years of extremely chaotic self-study, I can speak German well enough to live my life in it. I moved to Austria about a month ago and whenever I step outside my apartment I'm operating close to 100% in German.   I'm not perfect, but nobody needs to switch to English for me.

This is all to say: something clearly played out differently with German than it did with Spanish.

## Normal, chaotic, and busy people can learn German

I allude vaguely to how I learned German in a lot of my posts and tweets, but I never sat down and put the story together all in one place — until now.

**This is the story of how I learned German from zero to C1 in about three years of unplanned, mostly unsupervised, and totally chaotic self study that mostly involved listening to podcasts and reading for pleasure.**

My goal here is to show you that learning a new language to a high level doesn't require a hardcore study plan, organization scheme, or intense regime of traditional group classes.

**If you're chaotic and can't stick to routines — I can't — you can still do it. If you're busy adult with a real life, you can still do it.** 

All you really need is a few years, headphones, and a bunch of dead time: a commute, chores to do, meals to cook, laundry to fold, or whatever mindless tasks make you think you don't have time for a language in the first place.

That's the beauty of languages. Your brain will do most of the heavy lifting of learning for you if you just get out of the way and let it work.

{{< notice note "What to do during that dead time?" >}}

Spoiler alert: I learned German using _comprehensible input_ — basically, by listening to podcasts and audiobooks, watching TV, and reading for fun. Comprehensible input is language input you can mostly understand but not entirely. It also lets you turn dead time into language learning time.

That's why I write a **free newsletter** for German learners recommending great new German media for comprehensible input learning every week.

Thank you to Elliot and Ian for their emails asking about my story. They're the reason I wrote this post. If there's something else you're curious about or would like to see on the blog, just shoot me an email — given the small readership your odds are pretty good that I'll write what you ask for ;)

## Why I started learning German

I started learning German during my last year of my bachelor's degree. It was basically an accident and happened thanks to a class on the history of English and a job in Denmark.

My undergraduate university required science students to take a handful  of elective courses in English or history. A professor I'd previously taken a class from that I enjoyed was teaching a class on the "History of the English Language" and I signed up. 

I still don't know why, but something about Old English just enthralled me. I loved its strange but somehow familiar logic. I loved how it'd smoosh words together to make kennings, I loved learning about grammatical case for the first time, I loved its sound. I wanted _more_.

But... Duolingo doesn't have Old English. So I settled for German as the next best thing. The idea was just to play around for a month or so during the class to get a feel for how some of the grammar I liked in Old English worked in a living language related to English that retained those features.

That's how I started. I kept going because I landed a 9-month job in Denmark. Danish has only 5.5 million or so native speakers and it's pretty dang difficult to find good Danish-learning resources for free online. 

Meanwhile, German is swimming in resources, has something like 90 million native speakers, and it's related to Danish — my thinking was that learning German would be easier and more useful _now_ and also would help me pick up Danish later if I ended up staying in Denmark (I didn't).

## How I started teaching myself German as a beginner

I started with Duolingo and gradually started adding resources from there over a few months. It was an organic process and I didn't think about it much or plan anything.

The first addition to Duolingo was the Coffee Break German podcast. I love the Coffee Break podcasts and think they're great resources for beginners. With Duolingo and Coffee Break, I started growing my vocabulary and awareness of basic grammar enough to begin understanding bits and pieces of  things in German.

### Accidentally starting to learn with comprehensible input

Sometime in the first few months, I started looking for German music. With Spotify's help I stumbled into the German-language "medieval folk" scene (as will happen if one plays a lot of Dungeons and Dragons and listens to playlists called stuff like "Tavern Jams"). I found a few artists I liked and started bingeing them. Nowadays I don't listen to them much... because I know enough German to find the lyrics cringe. Such is the price of progress.

I after a few months of Duolingo and Coffee Break German, I was curious about how well I could understand a German TV series. I tried out _Dark_ on Netflix. 

I absolutely was not "ready" for a show like _Dark._ Back then, I was not even really A1. I got maybe 10-20% of what I heard — English cognates and visual context help. 

> The more I listened and watched, the more I understood. **It became addictive**, especially at the beginning when my progress was so clear. So I kept listening more and more and more, and became more aggressive about seeking out media in German

But the show was still _so cool_. I wanted to watch it. I wanted to _understand_ it. And I really didn't have anything else to do — all my friends graduated a year before me so I spent most of my time just laying around at home alone.

So I binged _Dark_ with English subtitles and then re-watched it in German with German subtitles two or three times. And then I started to do the same thing with other shows.

I soon began doing something similar with podcasts and YouTube videos, too. I found podcasts in slow, clear German like _Slow German mit Annik Ruebens_ and _News in Slow German_ and listened through the episode catalogues multiple times.

It got to a point where I had something (usually a podcast, song, or YouTube video) in German going in my ears pretty much at all times when I didn't need to be thinking in English. Commuting, doing chores, cooking — any repetitive, mindless activity became German time. 

The more I listened and watched, the more I understood. It became addictive, especially at the beginning when my progress was so clear. So I kept listening more and more and more, and became more aggressive about seeking out media in German that I could enjoy consuming despite not understanding everything perfectly. 

It turns out that this is a legitimate learning method. **I'd stumbled into learning by comprehensible input, entirely by accident.**

## What is comprehensible input, and how do I use it to learn?

Before continuing, I want to stop and explain a bit about comprehensible input and go through exactly how I use it to learn.

Comprehensible input is input (writing or speech) in your target language that you _almost_ understand. 

If n = whatever you understand now, comprehensible input = n + 1.

Generally, folks seem to think that you need to understand 80-90% of something for it to be considered comprehensible input. I'm not sure where I stand on this — I definitely listened to content I _barely_ understood at the beginning. That's because I hate being bored.

{{< notice note "How to find interesting comprehensible input as a beginner" >}}

Baby stuff for beginners is very comprehensible. But it is also super boring. 

Boring is bad. To learn via comprehensible input, some researchers think that the input needs to be _both_ comprehensible _and_ interesting to you. 

Basically, you need to be actively interested and paying attention to the input you consume for it to work — your brain needs to think it's important enough to bother putting in the energy to learn the learning the language for it. 

**My solution to beginner boredom is re-watching and re-listening to things you already love, but translated into your target language.** 

Since you already know the story, it's much easier to follow what's going on and stay engaged and entertained even if you only really understand 20% of the language. I watched _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ in German a truly embarrassing number of times.

## Summary: My tips for self-teaching German

I received an email from a reader recently that is perhaps the best summary of how I feel about where my learning "approach" (tamed chaos) fits into the language learning world:

> I think in general what I appreciated most on your blog was seeing someone reach a proficient level in the target language at a reasonable, steady pace and whilst having fun. **Most B2 videos are boasting about their 3-6 month super, intensive method, but I had the feeling that it should be attainable with 2 years of not really doing much actually.** Finding someone like yourself who had gone and done that was massively reassuring.

That about sums it up: I learned German in about 2 years of not really doing much actually.

Post over. Move along folks.

Ok, there's a bit more to it than that. Even though I don't think I'll beat the poetry and concision of that lovely summary, I still want to try.
