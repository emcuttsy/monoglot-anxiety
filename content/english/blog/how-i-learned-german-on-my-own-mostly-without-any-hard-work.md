Spanish was my best subject in high school. I aced my Spanish courses for four years. And yet still can't really speak any Spanish at all.

Meanwhile, after 3 years of extremely chaotic self-study, I can speak German well enough to live my life in it. I moved to Austria about a month ago and whenever I step outside my apartment I'm operating close to 100% in German.   I'm not perfect, but nobody needs to switch to English for me.

This is all to say: something clearly played out differently with German than it did with Spanish.

## You don't need to be organized or have loads of free time to learn German

I allude vaguely to how I learned German in a lot of my posts and tweets, but I never sat down and put the story together all in one place — until now.

This is the story of how I learned German from zero to C1 in about three years of unplanned, mostly unsupervised, and totally chaotic self study that mostly involved bingeing podcasts and reading for pleasure.

My goal here is to show you that learning a new language to a high level doesn't require any kind of hardcore study plan, organization scheme, or intense regime of traditional group classes.

If you're chaotic and can't stick to routines — I can't — you can still do it. If you're busy adult with a real life, you can still do it. All you really need is a few years, headphones, and a bunch of dead time: a commute, chores to do, meals to cook, laundry to fold, or whatever mindless tasks make you think you don't have time for a language in the first place.

That's the beauty of languages. Your brain will do most of the heavy lifting of learning for you if you just get out of the way and let it work.

{{< notice note "What to do during that dead time?" >}} 

Spoiler alert: I learned German using _comprehensible input_ — basically, by listening to podcasts and audiobooks, watching TV, and reading for fun. Comprehensible input is language input you can mostly understand but not entirely.

That's why I write a **free newsletter** for German learners recommending great new German media for comprehensible input learning every week.

Thank you to Elliot and Ian for their emails asking about my story. They're the reason I wrote this post. If there's something else you're curious about or would like to see on the blog, just shoot me an email — given the small readership your odds are pretty good that I'll write what you ask for ;)

## Why I started learning German

## How I started teaching myself German as a beginner

## I discovered comprehensible input by accident

## From beginner to intermediate German

I received an email from a reader recently that is perhaps the best summary of how I feel about where my learning "approach" (tamed chaos) fits into the language learning world:

> I think in general what I appreciated most on your blog was seeing someone reach a proficient level in the target language at a reasonable, steady pace and whilst having fun. **Most B2 videos are boasting about their 3-6 month super, intensive method, but I had the feeling that it should be attainable with 2 years of not really doing much actually.** Finding someone like yourself who had gone and done that was massively reassuring.

That about sums it up: I learned German in about 2 years of not really doing much actually.

Post over. Move along folks.

Ok, there's a bit more to it than that. Even though I don't think I'll beat the poetry and concision of that lovely summary, I still want to try.
