I received an email from a reader recently that summed up my language learning journey better than I ever could in a full post:

> I think in general what I appreciated most on your blog was seeing someone reach a proficient level in the target language at a reasonable, steady pace and whilst having fun. **Most B2 videos are boasting about their 3-6 month super, intensive method, but I had the feeling that it should be attainable with 2 years of not really doing much actually.** Finding someone like yourself who had gone and done that was massively reassuring.

That about sums it up: I learned German in about 2 years of not really doing much actually.

Post over. Move along folks.

Ok, there's a bit more to it than that. Even though I don't think I'll beat the poetry and concision of that lovely summary, I still want to try.
