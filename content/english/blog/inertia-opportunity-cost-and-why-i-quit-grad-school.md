There are at least two fundamental truths of the universe that we learn in 8th grade science class and never forget. First: the mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell. Second: a body in motion stays in motion, and a body at rest stays at rest, unless acted upon by an outside force.

This is Newton's first law, the law of inertia, which describes the tendency of anything with mass to keep following whatever path it's currently on until forced to change course. It is a fundamental and profound truth about the universe, and one of many reasons astronaut baseball probably won't catch on (miss a catch and the ball will keep flying in a straight line, _forever_). 

Human bodies are a tad more complicated than the theoretical hockey pucks sliding across frictionless ice rinks that were the typical "bodies in motion" involved in my 8th grade physics homework problems. Human lives are more complicated still, and only debatably physical. But life certainly has its own kind of inertia. 

We often just slide along on whatever path we're on until we bump into something, or get smacked by a theoretical, frictionless hockey stick. **And we do this—or at least I do this—even when the path clearly isn't leading anywhere good.**

My question is: why? People are not frictionless hockey pucks. When it comes to matters of the mind, it's a stretch to consider Newton's laws anything more than Newton's loose suggestions. So where does this sense of inertia come from?

## "Wow, you're so brave!"

Last week was my last real week as a scientist. After four years of bachelors study at Caltech, a Fulbright at a Danish lab, and two years in a PhD program at MIT, I called it quits and left behind a career that by all accounts was going pretty well.

My loose plan is to become a science writer. This seems to be off to a good start. This summer, I'll cover science news for Voice of America as an AAAS Mass Media Fellow. 

After that... who knows? I certainly don't. 

People kind of expect you to have more of a plan when you announce big life changes. And intentionally burning your bridge into career territory that many would see as enviable is perceived as particularly crazy. Basically, unless "I'm leaving my PhD position at MIT and quitting science" is followed directly by "to take a 6-figure job at Google/end world hunger/run for president/\[insert life-changing opportunity here\]" people wonder if you screwed up somehow. 

My experience has taught me that the baseline assumption is that leaving your current situation is nuts unless you've got something obviously better lined up. Why
