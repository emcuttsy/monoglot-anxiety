Today in German class, I had an interesting conversation with my teacher about _gendern_ in German — a relatively new practice of specifically using  both the masculine and feminine forms of words describing people (and sometimes symbols to represent third genders) instead of the generic masculine.

This is considered more socially progressive because it doesn't treat masculine forms as the default and explicitly includes women. Directly translated to English, it'd be like saying "male astronauts and female astronauts" instead of just "astronauts."

The thing is, I _really_ don't like to gendern — not because I think women don't matter (I consider myself a feminist) and not just because it makes German sentences so clunky that practically nobody _gendern_-s in casual speech.

Really, I don't like _gendern_ because, as an English-speaking woman, it rubs my feminist instincts when it comes to language the wrong way.

Why, my thinking goes, is it helpful to further emphasize the division between men and women by constantly saying things like "male doctors and female doctors" instead of just "doctors?" Why do I need to call myself a "female journalist" every time I talk about my job? Why can't I just be a journalist? We don't make men call themselves "male journalists" all the time.

Of course, my German teacher, a native German speaker from Austria, felt the exact opposite. To her, not using the feminine forms feels like erasing women from existence.

I found this mismatched perception fascinating and wanted to dig into it a bit more. This post explains what "gendern" is in German, why people do it, and why I find it uncomfortable — but still do it anyways.

## Grammatical gender in German

In German, all nouns are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. The words for "the" and "a/an" as well as adjectives and adverbs all change depending on a word's gender.

Grammatical gender in German doesn't always align with natural gender. For instance, "the girl" is in German is neuter-gender "das Madchen" — like all other German words ending in _-chen_.

Mark Twain famously lamented this in his essay _The Awful German Language:_

> Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the distribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what callous disrespect for the girl.

Long story short, it's basically impossible to talk about anything in German without its grammatical gender coming into play.

### The generic masculine

German words for people like "doctor," "artist," and "murderer" are almost always masculine in their base or "generic" form.

To talk about a female doctor, artist, or tyrant, you'd need to change the word by adding the suffix _-in_ and sometimes making some other small changes.

Here are a few examples:

The doctor: _der Arzt_ (masculine), _die Ärztin_ (feminine), die Ärzte (plural masculine), _die Ärztinnen_ (plural feminine)
The artist: _der Kunstler_ (masculine), _die Kunstlerin_ (feminine), die Kunstler (plural masculine), _die Kunstlerinnen_ (feminine)
The murderer: _der Mörder_ (masculine), _die Mörderin_ (feminine), _die Mörder_ (plural masculine), _die Mörderinnen_ (plural feminine)

Mark Twain complained about this too, for the record:

> In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (Weib) is not--which is unfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according to the grammar, a fish is HE, his scales are SHE, but a fishwife is neither. To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description; that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German speaks of an Englishman as the ENGLÄNDER; to change the sex, he adds INN, and that stands for Englishwoman-- ENGLÄNDERINN. That seems descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: "die Engländerinn,"--which means "the she-Englishwoman." I consider that that person is over-described.

The masculine form is clearly the base form, with the feminine words derived from the simpler masculine version. There's no getting around that.

As women started to adopt traditionally masculine roles, the masculine form started to be used to refer to mixed groups (in plural) and to professional roles and other titles in general.

If you know Spanish, French, or another Romance language, you probably can tell where this is going. For doctors:

* A male doctor: _Arzt_ (masculine, singular)
* A female doctor: _Ärztin_ (feminine, singular)

A group of doctors that is...

* 100 men:  _Ärzte_ (masculine, plural)
* 50 woman + 50 men: _Ärzte_ (masculine, plural)
* 99 women + 1 man: _Ärzte_ (masculine, plural)
* 100 women: _Ärztinnen_ (feminine, plural)

Notice how a mixed group always takes the masculine form, even if it is mostly women.

Even further — and more important for understanding _gendern_ — is the concept of the **generic masculine**.

Essentially, when speaking in general about the concept of "doctor" or "doctors," or about some undetermined doctor whose gender isn't known or important, you'd use the masculine _Arzt_ or _Ärzte_ (plural).

But while masculine words can refer to women, feminine words can _only_ refer to women. When used to speak in general about groups or individuals, they're restricted to only female people:

The concept "doctors" in general: _Ärzte_ (masculine, plural)
The concept of "female doctors" in general: _Ärztinnen_ (feminine, plural)
The concept of "doctor" in general: _Arzt_ (masculine, singular)
The concept of "female doctor" in general: _Ärztin_ (feminine, singular)

Because the masculine is generic, to talk about "male doctors" specifically, you'd either need to make your usage clear from context or say something like _männliche Ärzte_ — male (male) doctors.

## Gendern - what is it?

Many German speakers rightfully felt that using the generic masculine and specific feminine forms this way erases women, even if they're techincally "meant-together" (_mitgemeint_) in the generic masculine.

The solution is to _gendern_.

_Gendern_ — from the English word _gender_, which didn't exist in German until recently — is the practice of explicitly including both the male and female forms of words for people in written, and sometimes spoken language.

In some cases, people also use special punctuation marks and insert otherwise unnatural stops into their speech to include certain trans people as well.

### What would gendern look like in English?

Directly translated into English, to _gendern_ would mean saying things like this:

_We are looking for an experienced male doctor or a female doctor._

_The male politicians and female politicians will vote on Thursday._

_The male teachers and female teachers and nonbinary teachers are on strike_.

I don't know about you, but reading sentences like that makes me really uncomfortable.

### What gendern looks like in German

In German, things get even more annoying because adjectives, adverbs, and articles (the/a) all change depending on the genders of the words they describe. This means you have to either make sentences very long or use awkward unpronouncable neologisms to explicitly include both forms

Generic masculine:
The teacher: _der Lehrer_
A good teacher _ein guter Lehrer_
The teachers: _die Lehrer_

With _gendern_:

* The teacher: _die Lehrerin oder der Lehrer_
* A good teacher: _eine gute Lehrerin oder ein guter Lehrer_
* The teachers: _die Lehrerinnen und Lehrer_

Because writing out all this is clunky and long, German speakers use a lot of abbreviations in writing to get around the problem. They are also starting to use special characters like * and : to represent nonbinary identities.

There's a good summary on [this webpage](https://www.dialog-wien.at/ueber-uns/blog/what-is-gendern-in-german/). But here are some examples of how you'll see _gendern_ abbreviated in text — and really just in text, this stuff is downright unpronouncable:

Generic masculine:

* The worker: _der Arbeiter_
* A good worker: _ein guter Arbeiter_
* The workers: _die Arbeiter_

With _gendern_:

* The worker (women + men): _die/der ArbeiterIn_
* The worker (+ nonbinary): _die*der Arbeiter*in_ OR _Arbeiter:in_
* A good worker (women + men): _ein/e gut/er ArbeiterIn_
* A good worker (+ nonbinary): _ein*e gut*er Arbeiter*in_ OR _Arbeiter:in_
* The workers (women + men): _die ArbeiterInnen_
* The workers (+ nonbinary): _die Arbeiter*innen_ OR _Arbeiter:innen_

## My problem with _gendern_

Although _gendern_ is meant to make women feel included, I really don't like it. I also really don't like having to use feminine versions of words for people whenever I describe myself.

Why? Do I think being female makes me less valuable somehow?

Absolutely not. But you're being willfully ignorant if you insist that the forms are equal, linguistically, and will ever feel equal — the masculine forms are obviously the base form. They are shorter, easier to pronounce, simpler forms from which the female versions are derived.

I don't like to _gendern_ because I feel like it forces me to explicitly bring attention to my sex all the time even though it isn't — and shouldn't be — relevant most of the time.

Men get to describe themselves in words that are far more neutral. Although grammatically masculine, they are clearly the base form and can — and are _frequently_, especially in everyday speech — used generically to refer to men, women, and the concept the word represents in general.

In English, very few words for people have explicitly feminine forms. "Actor" and "actress" are the only common pair that come to mind for me, though there (very) outdated feminine forms like "doctoress" and "authoress" do exist.

This means that even though the "generic" words for doctor, lawyer, runner, author, etc. in English derive from the masculine forms of the words, they don't _feel_ masculine. They feel like... nothing. They don't have a sex baked in.

This is why using the explicitly feminine forms feels like it unnecessarily highlights someone's female-ness in situations where sex has nothing to do with anything — it feels backwards, not progressive. Turned around, this is also the reason saying "male nurse" when a nurse's gender isn't important feels cringe.

So while German has decided to explicity gender everything, English went the other way: the trend in English has been to drop what few explicitly feminine titles that still exist (like actress) and use the same words to describe men and women whenever possible.

## How I wish it worked: how German handles gender mismatch for animals

German can be more flexible than people give it credit for, however. There's at least one common situation in which the language rather nicely handles mismatch between grammatical and natural gender — describing animals.

Mismatch between grammatical and natural gender is common for animal words. The words for dog, fish, and bird are masculine. The words for cat, snake, and owl are feminine. The words for horse, pig, and sloth are neuter. But there are obviously female dogs, male snakes, and sexed horses in this world.

How does German handle this?

There _are_ sex-specific versions of many animal names that people use when it is relevant. For instance, the sex-specific forms of "die Katze", the cat, are "die Kätzin" and "der Kater" for female and male cats, respectively.

Using these sex-specific forms can make sense when talking about breeding animals or if someone really want to call out an animal's  sex for some reason — perhaps to contrast the behavior or biology of males and females of the same species.

But in everyday speech, you're just not going to hear people use these forms, even if they're talking about an animal whose biological sex doesn't match up with its grammatical gender.

Instead, the way this usually plays out in conversation when talking about an animal whose sex you know is the opposite of its grammatical gender is something like this:

Stranger: Your **dog (masculine)** ist very cute. What breed is **he (masculine)**?
Me: Thank you! **She's (feminine)** a **German Shepherd (masculine).**
Stranger: **She's (feminine)** really pretty. What a **good girl (neuter)**!

And in German:

_Fremder:_ **Dein Hund** ist sehr süß. Was für eine Rasse ist **er**?
_Ich_: Danke! **Sie** ist **ein** **Deutscherschäferhund.**
_Fremder:_ **Sie** ist wirklich schön. Was für ein **braves Mädchen**!

When talking about an animal whose sex you know, you'd use the corresponding masculine or feminine pronoun to talk about them. The species name is simply the name of the category to wich the animal belongs and its grammatical gender doesn't need to match the animal's sex.

Something similar happens when you use metaphors to compare people to an inanimates object in German — you don't change the inanimate object's gender to match the person you're comparing it to.

This is basically how I wish it would work with gendered job titles and most other words for types of people  in German. The base form (which is almost always grammatically masculine) would be a category name like an animal species name. Saying I'm a journalist would look like this:

Stranger: What do you do?   
Me: I'm a **journalist (masculine)  
** Stranger: Cool, my **sister(feminine)** and my **brother(masculine)** are also **journalists(masculine)**!

_Fremder: Was machst du beruflich?_
_Ich: Ich bin Journalist_
_Fremder: Super, meine Schwester und mein Bruder sind auch Journalisten._

## Why it's hard to find a good solution

Of course, there are good reasons that German speakers don't do this, even though it'd be easier.

Unlike in English, almost all German words for people have either masculine or feminine gender. Imagine if nearly every word describing a person behaved like the "actress/actor" pair.

And I mean nearly every word for people, not just job titles. I jokingly called myself a "tyrant," a _Tyrann_ today in German class and my teacher corrected me to the feminine _Tyrannin_.

Because the feminine forms of German words for people exist and are used so often, hearing the "generic" masculine form doesn't sound generic like it does in English — it sounds masculine.

While "Journalisten" sounds like journalists to me , it sounds like "male journalists, and _maybe_ women if you remember they also exist" to many German speakers.

## Two schools of thought on representation in language

Beyond linguistic differences, this conflict seems to me like a mismatch between to different ideas of what it means to achieve gender equality.

On one side is the anglophone viewpoint — equality between the sexes means using the same language to describe everyone when possible.

Make everything as gender-neutral as possible. Drop whatever remaining explicitly female forms there still are and adopt the "generic" (once masculine, now widely used) forms for everyone. On the most extreme end, try not to use gendered terms even for ideas directly linked to biological sex (i.e., birthing parent instead of mother, people with testicles instead of men)

On the other side is the German viewpoint — equality between the sexes means both sexes are equally visible. In practice, this means explictly pointing out women who are otherwise invisibly swept into the generic masculine.

So, lean harder into the male/female distinction in job titles and normalize use of the female title alongside the male version. Write "we want to hire a male doctor or female doctor" and not just "we want to hire a doctor (generic masculine)." Create new feminine forms of titles that didn't have a feminine form before, like Bundeskanzler (prime minister) — Bundeskanlzerin. Explicitly note everyone's sex and make sure women aren't forgotten.

I find the second solution uncomfortable because I don't think my sex is relevant in most context and it feels weird to me to — albiet indirectly — bring my sex organs into the discussion. I do the same work as a male journalist, so why should we use different words to describe the same work?

Ultimately, it's not my opinion that matters, though. How German tickles my anglophone reflexes is not the point — it's what German-speaking people feel.

And I certainly understand why someone who grew up speaking a thoroughly gendered language in which the masculine clearly dominates would think "hey,  isn't it about time that you include the women for once!"

That's why I _do_ _gendern_. Even if it gives me a bit of a stomachache.

## What do you think? How is gender-inclusive language handled in your language?

I'd love to hear what you think about this. If you're learning German, do you find _gendern_ uncomfortable, too? How is gender-inclusive language handled in your native language or target languages? If you speak German, how well do you think the current solutions for inclusive language work in German?
