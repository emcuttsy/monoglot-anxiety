## The way we learn languages in school is wrong.

Decades of research show that becoming fluent in a new language requires **comprehensible input**, not the rote memorization and drills you'll find in most textbooks.

The good news is that learning a language via comprehensible input is far more fun and far less boring than using traditional methods. And better yet — learning via input works great for busy or chaotic people who can't make dedicated time to study. 

I'm a _huge_ fan of comprehensible input and it's the core of how I learn languages today. I would never have been able to [teach myself German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/) and score nearly perfect on the Goethe B2 German exam without it.

But what exactly _is_ comprehensible input?

I talk a lot about input on this blog and on Twitter without ever fully explaining what it is. I wanted to finally change that.

In this post I explain **what comprehensible input is**, the **science behind it** and **how to use it for language learning.**

## What is comprehensible input?

**Comprehensible input (CI) is anything in your target language that you can understand despite not getting every little detail.**

There's no universal consensus on how much you need to understand for input to be considered "comprehensible." I often see numbers between 80% and 95% thrown around.

Personally, I define comprehensible input as any language that I can understand well enough to _stay interested and engaged_, even if I don't understand everything. In my experience, "comprehensible" for me can mean anywhere from 20-100% understanding depending on what I'm watching, reading, or listening to.

Being able to stay engaged is critical — and although it's often overlooked, it's  actually been part of the theory around comprehensible input and language learning from the beginning.

### Optimal input

### Comprehensible input examples

The good news is that comprehensible input is easy to come by. Anything in your target language that you understand well enough to stay engaged in is comprehensible input.

There are three types of input: audio, audio-visual, and text:

* **Audio:** podcasts, audiobooks, telephone conversations
* **Audio-visual:** TV series, movies, YouTube, in-person conversations, video calls
* **Text:** books, articles, graded readers, social media, text conversations

Both content intended for native speakers and resources designed for learners can be comprehensible input, but don't get too cozy with beginner content. It is intimidating to make the jump to the real stuff, but it's an important. It will greatly deepen your connection to and interest in the culture(s) associated with the language you're learning and expand the landscape of (interesting! compelling!) input you can consume immensely.

If you want to get started with input but need a bit of guidance, I put together a [free cheat sheet with 11 tips to help beginners start learning a language via comprehensible input.](https://monoglotanxiety.ck.page/11-tips-for-beginners) This is the advice I gave my mom when she started learning German!

{{<notice note "Use a VPN to access foreign-language content">}}

Unfortunately, a lot of foreign-language content online is geographically restricted. This can make finding comprehensible input hard. Using a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is an easy way to securely access foreign language content for input if you don't live in the "right" country. 

[You can get 81% Surfshark VPN](https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=926&aff_id=15373&url_id=1288&source=blog-comprehensible-input) using my link. Surfshark is my pick for language learners because it is made for streaming, supports multiple devices, stands out for its international focus — you can use it in 16 languages and there are servers in 100 countries, including multiple options in Africa and South America.

**I really think a VPN is one of the few things you can pay for that can truly make a difference in learning a language via comprehensible input.** If you ask me, most textbooks aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

_Note: Using a VPN to get around location restrictions can be against the terms of service of streaming sites. I'm not encouraging you to break the rules!_

### Is comprehensible input the same thing as immersion?

Though often used interchangeably, comprehensible input is not the same thing as immersion.

Immersion is an activity or a method for language learning. Immersion means living in an environment where you're constantly surrounded by your target language and learning through your natural exposure to it.

We often think of immersion as living in a country where your target language is spoken. But some language learners also create or take advantage of immersion environments in their home countries, too. This can be as simple as switching over all your devices and media consumption to a new language or as serious as attending an immersion school as a child or signing up for an immersion camp or program.

Comprehensible input is different. It isn't a technique or learning method. It's simply material in your target language that you can mostly but not entirely understand.

Of course, when you immerse, you get a _lot_ of comprehensible input. That's probably why immersion works so well — there are few better ways to rack up hours of comprehensible input consumption in a short amount of time.

**But ultimately, immersion is just one of many ways to incorporate comprehensible input into a language learning strategy.**

You might be used to different definitions of comprehensible input and immersion. I know, for instance, that Refold.la, which outlines a structured input-based learning method, [defines these terms differently](https://community.refold.la/faqs/).

Settling on a definition is tricky, especially since the term "comprehensible input," while popular among language learners, isn't used much by modern second-language acquisition researchers. However, the core concepts associated with comprehensible input live on (and thrive) under other names — focus on meaning vs focus on form, implicit vs explicit learning, etc.

I based my definitions of comprehensible input and immersion on:

* Stephen Krashen's writings and research
* Contemporary scholarly works — especially _this_ paper
* The usage of these terms "in the wild" in the language learning community

## The science of comprehensible input

The things I say about comprehensible input are not things I thought up myself. There's a huge body of research on input and language learning — my own personal experiences just happen to be consistent with it.

This topic really deserves its own post, so just think of this as a crash-course meant to get you familiar with where the idea of comprehensible input comes from and why we know it works.

### Stephen Krashen and Monitor Theory

The idea of "comprehensible input" is often accredited to linguist Stephen Krashen.

That said, Krashen happily points out that he is not the first person to think about comprehensible input and language learning. 

Monitor Theory 

### Language acquisition vs language learning

There's not room in this post to get into every aspect of Monitor Theory, but one of the most important ones to understand regarding comprehensible input is the **difference between language acquisition and language learning.**

According to Krashen (and others), **_learning about_ a language is not the same as _acquiring_ one.** A language is not just another academic subject like history or chemistry.  [The brain has a special dedicated "language circuit" thought to be universal to all languages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01115-4) and which — critically — is separate from the areas of the brain involved in the kinds of recall tasks that traditional learning usually involves. Using language is an ability innate to all humans. Memorizing the year that William the Conquerer invaded England is not.

> It's not clear if the explicit knowledge we gain from _learning about_ languages actually translates into the implicit knowledge that we build as we _acquire_ them.

Language _acquisition_ is not like traditional learning. It is the unconscious process by which your brain builds up a working mental map of a new language that can be used flexibly — and unconsciously — to understand and communicate. And the only way to build up that map is to receive lots and lots of comprehensible input.

When you understand material in your new language (i.e., when you receive comprehensible input), your brain uses that input to build or refine its model of the language. You further _acquire_ the language.

And while research has shown that input alone is sufficient for language acquisition, the jury is still out as to whether the kinds of formal studying you're used to from traditional language classes (i.e., "focus on form") can actually help the acquisition process along at all.

In other words, it's not clear if the explicit knowledge we gain from _learning about_ languages actually translates into the implicit knowledge that we build as we _acquire_ them.

So go ahead memorize verb charts all you want, but your brain would probably prefer if you heard that verb in its various forms in context a few thousand times and let it put two-and-two together on its own.

## Comprehensible input strategies for language learning

There are countless ways to incorporate comprehensible input into whatever language learning routine — or non-routine — works best for you.

This section outlines a few tips for learning with comprehensible input and provides recommendations for resources that can help you learn faster (and less painfully).

If you're curious how I use input, you can read my story of how I learned German here. 

### Switch your media consumption to your target language

Your progress with comprehensible input depends on two variables: the quality of the input (see the Optimal Input hypothesis above) and the volume of the input.

Lingopie is essentially Netflix for language learners, with built-in features for making and reviewing flashcards as you watch TV in your target language. Its catalogue consists exclusively of "authentic" (i.e., made originally in the language) content and leans towards shorter films and episodes.

### Use audio to fill "dead time" with input

### Be choosy about language apps

Some language learning apps are built around comprehensible input to one degree or another. Especially as a beginner — that is, before you can really enjoy consuming media in your target language — apps like this can be a useful boost.

What you're looking for in a language app is _language in context_. Instead of memorizing words in isolation, apps built with CI in mind show you new words in sentences (at the very least) or full stories (which is better).

Here are some recommendations:

* Glossika combines comprehensible input with spaced repetition — it's my top pick for a flashcard app. After much experimentation with Anki I don't really like spaced repetition flashcards at all. But Glossika has a fantastic audio-only mode that you can do 100% hands free, turning it into structured comprehensible input. All sentences are voiced by real native speakers too, not robots, which is a cut above most competitors I've tried.
* Lingq teaches languages via a massive library of authentic content in dozens of languages. It was developed by Steve Kaufmann, a polyglot who learns languages via comprehensible input.
* Beelinguapp uses audiobooks, news, and songs to teach languages. In addition to Lingopie and Lingq, it's probably the most obviously CI-oriented app I've tried.
* Speakly has well-curated example sentences and listening exercises that are great for CI. Its core product is a traditional close-deletion style app but and all words are taught and learned in context.
* Duolingo's stories and podcasts are a great free resources for languages that have these features! I'm not a huge fan of the core Duolingo app, but it also uses sentences for context so it's not the worst.

### Find a tutor who uses comprehensible input to teach

## Conclusion

Still, while I do have a few affiliate links on this site (and would be deeply thankful if you used one of them), I will reiterate that **you do not _need_ fancy tools to learn via comprehensible input.**

You just need a way — preferably many ways — to access media in your target language that you like enough to spend _hundreds of hours_ listening to, watching, and reading.

For me, that way was my mom's Netflix account, Spotify, YouTube, a library card, Duolingo, and a few graded readers.
