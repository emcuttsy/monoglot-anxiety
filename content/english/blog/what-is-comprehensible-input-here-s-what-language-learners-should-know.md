## FIRST SENTENCE

Discovering comprehensible input was nothing short of revolutionary for me when it came to learning languages. I would never have been able to [self-teach German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/) without it.

In this post I explain **what comprehensible input is**, its **origins in linguist Stephen Krashen's "input hypothesis,"** and **how comprehensible input can make you a better, faster, and less stressed-out language learner.**

## Comprehensible input is language that you mostly, but not entirely, understand

Comprehensible input (CI) is a fancy term for a simple idea: speech or text in your target language that you can mostly, but not entirely, understand.

Put another way, CI is anything in your target language that you get the gist of despite not understanding every little detail.

There's no universal consensus on how much you need to understand for input to be considered "comprehensible." I often see numbers between 80% and 95% thrown around.

Personally, I define comprehensible input as any language that I can understand enough to _stay interested and engaged_, even if I don't understand everything.

Being able to stay engaged is critical — and although it's often overlooked, it's  actually been part of the theory around comprehensible input and language learning from the beginning.

### Is comprehensible input the same thing as language immersion?

Comprehensible input is not the same thing as immersion, though the two are certainly connected.

Immersion is an activity or a method. Immersion means surrounding yourself as best as possible with your target language and learning via exposure to 

### Comprehensible input examples

### Comprehensible input and language learning

This is all fine and good, but what does comprehensible input have to do with language learning?

A lot, it turns out. 

Comprehensible input is the fuel for your brain's language-acquisition machine.

Pablo from Dreaming Spanish has an excellent video explaining comprehensible input, its origins in Krashen's theories, and some of the later research testing the input hypothesis on his channel. The video is in Spanish but there are English subtitles:

## Comprehensible input strategies for language learning

### Spend as much time as possible consuming media in your target language

### Use language learning tools that teach via comprehensible input

I used Netflix to use German, but there are plenty of great resources tailor-made to help language learners learn via comprehensible input. 

Refold.la offers one possible roadmap for learning with comprehensible input. I accidentally followed something similar when I learned German, though I didn't do any of the more intense study methods they recommend, such as making flashcards from TV subtitles.

The Language Reactor extension for Netflix is free and adds a ton of language-learning features to Netflix. I didn't use it much, but if you're following Refold's method it's super useful.

Lingopie is essentially Netflix for language learners, with built-in features for making and reviewing flashcards as you watch TV in your target language. Its catalogue consists exclusively of "authentic" (i.e., made originally in the language) content and leans towards shorter films and episodes. 

There's also Steve Kaufmann's learning website and app, Lingq. Kaufmann is a big believer in comprehensible input and Lingq teaches languages via a massive library of authentic content in dozens of languages.

### Do language apps use comprehensible input?

Some language learning apps are built around comprehensible input to one degree or another. Especially as a beginner — that is, before you can really enjoy consuming media in your target language — apps like this can be a useful boost. 

What you're looking for in a language app is _language in context_. Instead of memorizing words in isolation, apps built with CI in mind show you new words in sentences (at the very least) or full stories (which is better).

Beelinguapp uses audiobooks, news, and songs to teach languages. In addition to Lingopie and Lingq, it's probably the most obviously CI-oriented app I've tried.

I used Duolingo at the beginning with German, and it's free. However, I find the ads annoying and paid for Duolingo Plus back then. These days, I don't use Duo much because the new voices they introduced for the various characters really annoy me. Duolingo's close exercises are notoriously unnatural but it now has _stories_ for a handful of languages, which are basically interactive graded readers.

These days, I use Speakly instead of Duolingo. The core of Speakly is close exercises designed around a frequency list. But there are also listening and reading exercises that are designed to be used as comprehensible input.

### Find a tutor who uses comprehensible input to teach

### You don't need anything fancy to learn via comprehensible input

Still, while I do have a few affiliate links on this site (and would be deeply thankful if you used one of them), I will reiterate that **you do not _need_ fancy tools to learn via comprehensible input.**

You just need a way — preferably many ways — to access media in your target language that you like enough to spend _hundreds of hours_ listening to, watching, and reading. 

For me, that way was my mom's Netflix account, Spotify, YouTube, a library card, Duolingo, and a few graded readers.
