## FIRST SENTENCE

Discovering comprehensible input was nothing short of revolutionary for me when it came to learning languages. I would never have been able to [teach myself German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/) without it.

In this post I explain **what comprehensible input is**, its **origins in linguist Stephen Krashen's "input hypothesis,"** and **how to use comprehensible input for language learning.**

## What is comprehensible input?

Comprehensible input (CI) is anything in your target language that you can understand despite not getting every little detail.

There's no universal consensus on how much you need to understand for input to be considered "comprehensible." I often see numbers between 80% and 95% thrown around.

Personally, I define comprehensible input as any language that I can understand well enough to _stay interested and engaged_, even if I don't understand everything. In my experience, "comprehensible" for me can mean anywhere from 20-100% understanding depending on what I'm watching, reading, or listening to.

Being able to stay engaged is critical — and although it's often overlooked, it's  actually been part of the theory around comprehensible input and language learning from the beginning.

### Comprehensible input and the difference between learning and acquiring a language

This is all fine and good, but what does comprehensible input have to do with language learning?

A lot, it turns out.

That's because comprehensible input is the fuel for your brain's **language-acquisition** machine. And I use "acquisition" here very intentionally. 

Learning _about_ a language is not the same as _acquiring_ one. And comprehensible input is the key to _acquisition_ — the process by which your brain builds up a working mental model of a new language that it can use to spontaneously and flexibly interpret and communicate in that language.  

> It's not clear if the explicit knowledge we gain from _learning about_ languages actually translates into the implicit knowledge that we build as we _acquire_ them.

A language is not just another academic subject like history or chemistry.  Using language is an ability innate to all humans. Memorizing the year that William the Conquerer invaded England is not.

[The brain has a special dedicated "language circuit" thought to be universal to all languages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01115-4) and which — critically — is separate from the areas of the brain involved in the kinds of memory tasks that traditional learning usually involves.

When you understand material in your new language (i.e., when you receive comprehensible input), your brain uses that input to build or refine its model of the language. You further _acquire_ the language. 

And while research has shown that input alone is sufficient for language acquisition, the jury is still out as to whether the kinds of formal studying you're used to from traditional language classes (i.e., "focus on form") can actually help the acquisition process along at all. 

In other words, it's not clear if the explicit knowledge we gain from _learning about_ languages actually translates into the implicit knowledge that we build as we _acquire_ them.

So go ahead memorize verb charts all you want, but your brain would probably prefer if you heard that verb in its various forms in context a few thousand times and let it put two-and-two together on its own.

### Is comprehensible input the same thing as language immersion?

Comprehensible input is not the same thing as immersion, though the two are certainly connected.

Immersion is an activity or a method for language learning. Immersion means living in an environment where you're constantly surrounded by your target language and learning through your natural exposure to it.

We often think of immersion as living in a country where your target language is spoken. But some language learners also create or take advantage of immersion environments in their home countries, too. This can be as simple as switching over all your devices and media consumption to a new language or as serious as attending an immersion school as a child or signing up for an immersion camp or program.

Comprehensible input is different. It isn't a technique or learning method. It's simply material in your target language that you can mostly but not entirely understand.

Of course, when you immerse, you get a _lot_ of comprehensible input. That's probably why immersion works so well — there are few better ways to rack up hours of comprehensible input consumption in a short amount of time.

**But ultimately, immersion is just one of many ways to incorporate comprehensible input into a language learning strategy.**

My Italian tutor bases her lessons on comprehensible input and foreign-language teachers and SLA researchers all have their own opinions about how best to bring comprehensible input into the classroom. Florencia Henshaw of the [Unpacking Language Pedagogy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Unpackinglanguagepedagogy) channel on YouTube does a great job of breaking down some of the ways teachers use input in their lessons.

For my part, I learned German well enough to [score nearly perfectly on the Goethe B2 exam](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-passed-the-goethe-b2-german-exam-with-a-nearly-perfect-score/) just by switching most of my media consumption — but not my entire life — to German. That's not quite immersion in the traditional sense, even though I learned almost exclusively through exposure to input and not by studying.

{{<notice note "Wait a second — these aren't the definitions I'm used to">}}

You might be used to different definitions of comprehensible input and immersion. I know, for instance, that Refold.la, which outlines a structured input-based learning method, [defines these terms differently](https://community.refold.la/faqs/). 

Settling on a definition is tricky, especially since the term "comprehensible input," while popular among language learners, isn't used much by modern second-language acquisition researchers. However, the core concepts associated with comprehensible input live on (and thrive) under other names — focus on meaning vs focus on form, implicit vs explicit learning, etc. 

I based my definitions of comprehensible input and immersion on:

* Stephen Krashen's writings and research
* Contemporary scholarly works — especially _this_ paper
* The usage of these terms "in the wild" in the language learning community

I think the distinction between comprehensible input and immersion is useful enough to warrant strengthening and maintaining, so that's why I don't use these terms interchangeably. It's possible to learn via comprehensible input without immersion, and plenty of people who go off on immersion experiences focus far more on finding chances to produce output than on soaking up as much input as possible.

Of course, not everyone agrees with these definitions. The folks over at Refold.la define comprehensible

### Comprehensible input examples — where can you find comprehensible input?

The good news is that comprehensible input is easy to come by. It's not locked behind classroom doors or only accessible to people who can shell out cash for classes or expensive language programs.

#### Video comprehensible input: TV series, YouTube, and movies

#### Accessing

This all sounds well and good, but the problem is that a lot of foreign-language content is location-specific. Now that I live in Austria, it's a lot easier for me to stream series in German than it was in the US. And it's pretty much impossible to stream anything in Danish outside of Denmark.

Using a VPN is an easy way to get around this problem — and for certain languages like Danish

Pablo from Dreaming Spanish has an excellent video explaining comprehensible input, its origins in Krashen's theories, and some of the later research testing the input hypothesis on his channel. The video is in Spanish but there are English subtitles:

### Why didn't Krashen's

## Comprehensible input strategies for language learning

### Consume media in your target language — as much and as often as possible

Your progress with comprehensible input depends on two variables: the quality of the input (see the Optimal Input hypothesis above) and the volume of the input.

### Use audio to fill "dead time" with input

### Use language learning tools that teach via comprehensible input

I used Netflix to use German, but there are plenty of great resources tailor-made to help language learners learn via comprehensible input.

Refold.la offers one possible roadmap for learning with comprehensible input. I accidentally followed something similar when I learned German, though I didn't do any of the more intense study methods they recommend, such as making flashcards from TV subtitles.

The Language Reactor extension for Netflix is free and adds a ton of language-learning features to Netflix. I didn't use it much, but if you're following Refold's method it's super useful.

Lingopie is essentially Netflix for language learners, with built-in features for making and reviewing flashcards as you watch TV in your target language. Its catalogue consists exclusively of "authentic" (i.e., made originally in the language) content and leans towards shorter films and episodes.

There's also Steve Kaufmann's learning website and app, Lingq. Kaufmann is a big believer in comprehensible input and Lingq teaches languages via a massive library of authentic content in dozens of languages.

### Do language apps use comprehensible input?

Some language learning apps are built around comprehensible input to one degree or another. Especially as a beginner — that is, before you can really enjoy consuming media in your target language — apps like this can be a useful boost.

What you're looking for in a language app is _language in context_. Instead of memorizing words in isolation, apps built with CI in mind show you new words in sentences (at the very least) or full stories (which is better).

Beelinguapp uses audiobooks, news, and songs to teach languages. In addition to Lingopie and Lingq, it's probably the most obviously CI-oriented app I've tried.

I used Duolingo at the beginning with German, and it's free. However, I find the ads annoying and paid for Duolingo Plus back then. These days, I don't use Duo much because the new voices they introduced for the various characters really annoy me. Duolingo's close exercises are notoriously unnatural but it now has _stories_ for a handful of languages, which are basically interactive graded readers.

These days, I use Speakly instead of Duolingo. The core of Speakly is close exercises designed around a frequency list. But there are also listening and reading exercises that are designed to be used as comprehensible input.

### You don't need anything fancy to learn via comprehensible input

Still, while I do have a few affiliate links on this site (and would be deeply thankful if you used one of them), I will reiterate that **you do not _need_ fancy tools to learn via comprehensible input.**

You just need a way — preferably many ways — to access media in your target language that you like enough to spend _hundreds of hours_ listening to, watching, and reading.

For me, that way was my mom's Netflix account, Spotify, YouTube, a library card, Duolingo, and a few graded readers.
