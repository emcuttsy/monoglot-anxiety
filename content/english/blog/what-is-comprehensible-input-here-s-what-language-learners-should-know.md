* How I learned German

## FIRST SENTENCE

Discovering comprehensible input was nothing short of revolutionary for me when it came to learning languages. I would never have been able to [self-teach German to C1 level](https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/) without it. 

In this post I explain **what comprehensible input is**, its **origins in linguist Stephen Krashen's "input hypothesis,"** and **how comprehensible input can make you a better, faster, and less stressed-out language learner.** 

## Comprehensible input is language that you mostly, but not entirely understand

Comprehensible input (CI) is a fancy term for a simple idea: speech or text in your target language that you can mostly, but not entirely, understand.

Put another way, CI is anything in your target language that you get the gist of despite not understanding every little detail. 

There's no universal consensus on how much you need to understand for input to be considered "comprehensible." I often see numbers between 80% and 95% thrown around. 

Personally, I define comprehensible input as any language that I can understand enough to _stay interested and engaged_, even if I don't understand everything.

Being able to stay engaged is critical — and although it's often overlooked, it's  actually been part of the theory around comprehensible input and language learning from the beginning.

This is all fine and good, but what does comprehensible input have to do with language learning?

A lot, it turns out.

BLAHBLAH

### Is comprehensible input the same thing as language immersion?

Comprehensible input is not the same thing as immersion, though the two are certainly connected.

Pablo from Dreaming Spanish has an excellent video explaining comprehensible input, its origins in Krashen's theories, and some of the later research testing the input hypothesis on his channel. The video is in Spanish but there are English subtitles:
