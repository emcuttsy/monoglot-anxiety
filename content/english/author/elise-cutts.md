Elise Cutts is the geek behind Monoglot Anxiety. A former geobiologist, she traded her pipette for a pen in 2022 and now writes about science instead of doing it. She started learning German kind of by accident in 2019 and has been nerding out about languages ever since. She speaks English and German, and is learning Spanish and Italian.
