Monoglot Anxiety, like most websites, uses cookies. I've done my best to build my site using services that won't re-sell your data and which have put in the work to be compliant with laws like the GDPR and CPPA. And that's not just because I want to be compliantâ€”I truly believe in these kinds of laws, and think we all should have more control over the way our data is used.

That said, I'm not a lawyer or a web developer, so it is possible I've made a mistake. Please tell me if you see one, or if you have any questions about how I (or the services that power Monoglot Anxiety) use your data.

In addition to these services which I have chosen to work with, there are other entities that collect cookies on this site and on other sites around the internet.
