Monoglot Anxiety, like most websites, uses cookies. I've done my best to build my site using services that won't re-sell your data and which have put in the work to be compliant with laws like the GDPR and CPPA. And that's not just because I want to be compliantâ€”I truly believe in these kinds of laws, and think we all should have more control over the way our data is used.

That said, I'm not a lawyer or a web developer, so it is possible I've made a mistake. Please tell me if you see one, or if you have any questions about how I (or the services that power Monoglot Anxiety) use your data.

The services I've chosen to use with this site are: Netlify (web hosting), Comment.io (comments), Google Analytics (analytics), Gumroad (web store), and Youtube (embedded youtube videos). These services require cookies. **No marketing cookies are necessary for this site/improve the site experience.** Please disable them! They are collected by entities that aren't in my control (i.e. Google and Facebook's targeted ads). 

Statistics cookies allow me to see how many visitors I get to the site each day using Google Analytics. **So if you want to help me out, please allow statistics cookies.** However keep in mind that Gumroad also keeps statistics cookies for their own analytics. This is one reason why I am looking for an alternative to Gumroad for the near future.

Good? Alright. Onto the automatically-generated legal stuff:
