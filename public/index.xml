      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Being the good cornfed American girl that I am, I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn a second language growing up, and I ended up develop a nasty case of I now affectionately call monoglot anxiety: a sort of wallowing, often jealous panic surrounding having never learned to speak a second language, and fear of inevitably screwing up all the time if I did try to learn one.
For years, it held me back, but eventually, it drove me bonkers enough to grind to the end of Duolingo German.</description>
