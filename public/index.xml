      <description>Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re at the &amp;ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies&amp;rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this booster pack of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won&amp;rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!</description>

      <title>11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language</title>

      <description>Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!
But what to write?
Figuring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible.</description>

      <title>Anki template for German that automatically generates cloze deletions and color-codes nouns</title>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>A candid review of Pimsleur Danish</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/pimsleur-danish-review/</link>

      <description>I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I&amp;rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-classe-jahrgang-studienrichtung/</link>

      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <title>Booster Pack: German words for drunk</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/</link>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 18:31:32 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</guid>
      <description>In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.
A common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.</description>

      <title>Conditional formatting based on field content for Anki flashcards</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/conditional-formatting-based-on-field-content-for-anki-flashcards/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/conditional-formatting-based-on-field-content-for-anki-flashcards/</guid>
      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code for conditional formatting in Anki based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad?</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-duolingo-bad/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-duolingo-bad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Duolingo bad? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the &lt;strong&gt;German dative plural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Monoglot Anxiety is a blog about language learning with a focus on German and Danish. You might also be forgiven for thinking that it&amp;rsquo;s a blog about Anki, since I post a lot about Anki flashcards and make a lot of free Anki decks and templates.
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I speak German at between a B2 and C1 level and Danish at… -A1. I can&amp;rsquo;t humble-brag on the 15 languages I&amp;rsquo;ve taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I speak German at between a B2 and C1 level and Danish at… -A1. I can&amp;rsquo;t humble-brag on the 15 languages I&amp;rsquo;ve taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So instead of basing my posts on expertise, I base them on mistakes, trial-and-error, chance discoveries, and a good dose of self-deprecating humor.</description>
