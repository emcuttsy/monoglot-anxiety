      <description>Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!
But what to write?
Figuring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible.</description>

      <title>A candid review of Pimsleur Danish</title>

      <description>I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I&amp;rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>

      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <title>Anki template for German that automatically generates cloze deletions and color-codes nouns</title>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>

      <description>Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole &amp;ldquo;Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache&amp;rdquo; idea. And I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that many of the words that most often initiate a holy-$h!#-what-case-do-I-use death-spiral are the common verbs describing speech: sagen, fragen, and co.
The funny thing is, these verbs actually mostly–and I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;rsquo;get to the mostly bit–behave according to the usual rules dictating case in German.</description>

      <title>Conditional formatting based on field content for Anki flashcards</title>
      <link>https://suspicious-galileo-91919d.netlify.app/blog/conditional-formatting-based-on-field-content-for-anki-flashcards/</link>

      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad? Maybe, but it&#39;s still worth downloading</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duolingo gets a lot of flack in some corners of the language-learning internet, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: the German Dative Plural</title>
      <link>https://suspicious-galileo-91919d.netlify.app/blog/fehler-files-1-german-dative-plural/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Monoglot Anxiety is a blog about language and language learning with a focus on German and Danish.
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I speak German at between a B2 and C1 level and Danish at… -A1. I can&amp;rsquo;t humble-brag on the 15 languages I&amp;rsquo;ve taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So instead of basing my posts on expertise, I base them on mistakes, trial-and-error, chance discoveries, and a good dose of self-deprecating humor.</description>
