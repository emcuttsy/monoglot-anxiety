Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com to learn more.\nBeing vulnerable is hard for me. I pride myself on being super self-sufficient. In my friend group, I’m not the one that asks for help, I’m the one who gives it. I didn’t want to be a burden to those around me. So even in difficult times, I preferred to isolate myself, crying alone until I fell asleep instead of just reaching out to someone.\nThat’s why I’m super grateful for language learning. When I started learning Spanish, I had no idea that I was also learning the language of vulnerability.\nSpanish taught me to be vulnerable “¿Cuál es la fruta más paciente?” I muttered to myself over and over in the back of an uber on my way to my Spanish ceramic class, trying to memorize another horrible Spanish dad joke I’d found online. It was a ceramics class in Spanish, for Spanish speakers. My Spanish was barely A1.\nThe joke was my lifeline. My safety blanket. Even though my best friend—the class instructor—told me my presence was wanted, I couldn’t help but think that I would be a bother to the class. But I thought if I had a joke maybe I could make a few friends, at the very least get everyone in the class to tolerate me. My other friend’s words from the night before echoed in my head: “Ceramics is hard already but trying to learn it in a foreign language is pretty impossible.”\nI always wanted to learn Spanish. I would say in my day to day I am more of an island than a person who depends on community. In elementary school I learned to thrive on my own, often doing all the work for group projects myself. In college we learned how to work independently. At work I’ve always been praised for my ability to function without any support.\nSo it was no surprise that when I started learning Spanish on March 9, 2021, I started with resources like Pimsleur and Duolingo so that I didn’t need to interact with anyone .\nLearning a language takes time — and accountability I started learning Spanish because my mom and her boyfriend started to speak in Spanish with each other to hide secrets from me, and it became my mission to not be left out of dinner conversations.\nWhen I complained about them wielding Spanish as a means to isolate me from the table, my mom’s boyfriend dared me “to learn it, if it made me uncomfortable”. And that lit a fire under me. I quickly looked to the internet for answers on how to get started.\nAt the end of month two my motivation had started to dwindle.\nLearning a language is a process. It’s not quick and easy and because of that I found it less and less fun. I knew if I didn’t do something quick I would lose my momentum. I had already tried to learn Spanish many times before, and it always went the same way: I would get inspired for a week and then stop.\nI wanted this time to be different. I searched for ways to regain my drive. Then I remembered watching a video on YouTube from Goal Guys titled “Everything I Wish I Knew About Achieving Goals” ( https://youtu.be/UUQVuw5iIqI ). In the video, he mentioned needing accountability.\nAs a people person, it made sense to me that I would need people to create the kind of contagious energy that could maintain my will to learn Spanish for the long haul. I needed people. I needed help. I needed to be vulnerable.\nI was going to have to ask my friends who spoke Spanish to talk to me, to bear with me, to tolerate my mistakes. I needed to ask for help.\nGetting out of my comfort zone I was super nervous to ask. I composed a text and hit send to 4 friends and my aunt. 3 friends agreed and so did my aunt. My best friend, Kaylee, speaks Spanish and she was super down to help. Then the anxiety hit.\nLexie and her friend Kaylee during a Spanish video call session.\nI felt like I was interrupting Kaylee’s day. Two months in and my Spanish was absolutely horrible. I sounded like a two-year-old with my babbling. Maybe even a highly developed one-year-old. But I really wanted this so I swallowed my pride.\nI remember wondering: what are they getting out of this? I had always been the caretaker of my friends so it seemed weird to be the one needing help. It felt uncomfortable. I couldn’t shake the feeling that they would make fun of me.\nKaylee didn\u0026rsquo;t. She was warm and kind. She was actually super excited to help me, because I’ve always helped her and she felt like this was her opportunity to help me.\nMy aunt and my other friend did in fact make fun of my poor Spanish, though. My guy friend said I sounded like Peggy Hill from King of the Hill.\nIf you’re not familiar with the animated show, Peggy Hill claims to be fluent in Spanish, but her Spanish is really bad, and there are a few episodes where she mixes words and gets herself into some serious trouble.\nI was a little annoyed, but he rallied around me and said if anyone can learn a language it’s me because of my focus.\nAlso I’m not going to lie, I am a person who’s fueled by the doubts of others. Vengeance was my gasoline.\nSo him calling me Peggy Hill made the month of June a breeze when I studied. My aunt teased me, but I found the time with her helpful so I kept calling her on the weekends.\nSpanish showed me the positive side of vulnerability The more I practiced with my friends the more I found out the upside of vulnerability.\nI suddenly felt closer to all my friends who were helping me. It turned out showing my flaws allowed people in.\nMy aunt and I had not been super close, but from the weekly conversations I learned a lot about her. And I eventually learned that teasing was actually her love language. My friend who called me Peggy Hill said he was inspired to do stand-up comedy in Spanish because of me. He said if I could make a fool of myself, so could he. And I found myself knowing more details about my best friend Kaylee than I had ever thought possible.\nIt turned out being open to receive help allowed others to share their vulnerability with me.\nNot only that, but my goal became their goal. One week I was actually thinking about quitting Spanish and then I received a text from a friend about practicing Spanish. And I thought “Now I must continue on!” My friends and aunt even started to look forward to helping me, too!!\nEventually, I scheduled a few iTalki classes and discovered I really enjoyed making weekly time for Spanish. I also enjoyed having teachers because they could explain things and correct me.\nSo when Kaylee told me about the Spanish ceramics class at the studio she teaches at, I wrote it down as a goal. It was 3 months away, but at the time I was still under the illusion that my Spanish would be flawless by then.\n“Run towards the fear!” Cut to 3 months later and my Spanish was still trash. The class was going to happen and, to my surprise, Kaylee was teaching it. I asked her for permission to take her class and she was thrilled.\nBut I was scared when I remembered the comment my other friend had made: “Ceramics is hard in English, and you want to take it in another language. It’s impossible.”.\nAll my life, I have had one motto: “Run towards the fear!” I never want fear to control me. I had heard immersion is always a good thing, and I wanted to learn. Despite my anxiety, I signed up for the class and made my friend promise not to talk to me in English no matter what.\nLexie and her friend Kaylee at the pottery studio. Kaylee taught a Spanish-language ceramics class that Lexie signed up for — and to which she came prepared with plenty of terrible Spanish dad jokes.\nI planned as best I could. I had someone on Italki prep a lesson about different Spanish words that could come up in ceramics. I tried to memorize small talk questions, though I didn’t have enough time to learn the responses to the questions.\nI knew how to ask “what’s your job?” but the only jobs I knew were firefighter, nurse, and screenwriter. So I wasn’t as prepared as I would have liked to be.\nThat’s why I armed myself with the one thing I have always armed myself with my whole life: jokes.\nI looked up some corny dad jokes on the internet and tried to memorize them on my way to the class. I also practiced saying “Quieres eschuchar un chiste? (Want to listen to a joke?)” under my breath.\nWhen I got to the class, my hands trembled and I couldn’t stop thinking about how my accent was… less than ideal. But — again moving towards the fear — I said hello to a few people. We went around the room introducing ourselves. For me, the simple act of introducing myself set my heart racing. I struggled to say “Me llamo,” a phrase that I definitely knew.\nBut everyone was so supportive. And as my friend started talking, it started to sound like the adults in Charlie Brown, indiscernible “Blah, blah, blah, blah”. The only good thing about taking an art class is even if I didn’t understand the words, it was all being demoed in front of my eyes.\nNative speakers are scared of being judged, too For the most part everyone in the class was actually very quiet. I forgot that taking any class is very vulnerable. While I was scared of looking stupid in Spanish, they were scared of talking in public.\nAnother motto I always use in my day to day life is “all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage” (from the trailer of We Bought a Zoo). This would be a good time for 20 seconds of insane courage. So I took a breath and recited what I had practiced: “Quieres escuchar un chiste?”\nNow, looking back, I should have used the ustedes form because I wasn’t really talking to anyone specific.\nBut everyone responded “Sí!. They were just as hungry as I was for connection, and even if my Spanish wasn’t amazing, it broke the ice. I told my dad joke, people laughed, and conversations started to happen around the room.\nThere was a lot I didn’t understand, but I pushed forward knowing that tomorrow I will know a little more. While my Spanish wasn’t the best there is so much you can communicate with a smile and laugh. I made my first friends in Spanish in that class. I continue to make more and more friends because of Spanish, people that have changed my life and my world view for the better.\nWhen I went to pick up my pots I was told my pots exploded which made me sad, but I figured I probably didn’t understand some basic instructions which caused them to blow up. I told Kaylee that the place couldn’t find my pots but she found them.\nMy pots definitely looked like they were made in a second language. They might be ugly but there was in fact a whole lot of love in them.\nLexie\u0026rsquo;s first pot from her Spanish pottery class — it might \u0026ldquo;look like it was made in another language,\u0026rdquo; but that was kind of the point!\nLearning a language taught me that it’s okay to ask for help Learning a language has made me realize it’s not bad to ask for help. Vulnerability actually makes your life richer.\nSo if you have ever wanted to learn a language, but were afraid to book a class, talk to a friend or have had a bad experience in the past and are afraid to start again: DO IT.\nMake bad pots, make many mistakes, sound like Peggy Hill. You’ll build a community. Just don’t stop.\nPaso a paso. (Step by Step) If they make fun of you, let them. When you reach your goal their opinions won’t matter.\nMy teacher taught me this expression: “Sin prisa, pero sin pausa” (Without hurry, but without pause). Language mastery isn’t a 3 month process, it’s a long game.\nSo just keep going and if you ever feel worried keep a dad joke in your back pocket. You never know who needs to hear it.\nBesos XX\nLexie\nImagine Rose of Golden Girls and Billy Wilder had a lovechild who was magically a Black Puerto Rican comedian. Lexie Grace is smiley, relentlessly optimistic, big-hearted, and funny as all h*ck.\nRaised in Hollywood by a literal pack of wild female comedians (who always dropped her off at Catholic school on time) Lexie is used to being the odd one out: too Black for private school and too nerdy to not get beat up at Sunday School, Lexie has smiled through it all while making everyone else laugh along the way. She has also studied writing and directing at NYU, trained at Groundlings, Second City Hollywood, UCB, and just wrote a commercial for IKEA. Check out Lexie Grace’s comedy, and you’ll see why audiences everywhere are so enamored and entertained, they’re naming their babies after her (well that was one former stalker, but Lexie hopes to collect more namesakes as her career progresses.)\nYou can find Lexie on Twitter at @SpanishLexie for Spanish and @smilelexie for comedy, and at her website: www.SmileLexie.com\nThis post is the fourth in the “Real Language Stories\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; series, which tells the real stories of how language learners of all stripes (and all levels) learned their first foreign languages.

I gave my all in class and earned nearly perfect grades. But it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter — despite all that, I can\u0026rsquo;t really speak any Spanish at all.\nMeanwhile, after 3 years of extremely chaotic and disorganized self-study, I can speak German well enough to live my life in it. I scored almost perfect on the Goethe B2 German exam afer 2 years of mostly watching TV and listening to podcasts. I moved to Austria about a month ago and whenever I step outside my apartment I\u0026rsquo;m operating close to 100% in German. I\u0026rsquo;m not perfect, but nobody needs to switch to English for me.\nAll this is to say that something clearly played out differently with German than it did with Spanish.\nThe thing that played out differently was immersion — comprehensible input to be more precise.\nTable of Contents\nNormal, chaotic, and busy people can learn German Why I started learning German How I started teaching myself German as a beginner Accidentally starting to learn with comprehensible input What is comprehensible input, and how do I use it to learn? How to use comprehensible input as a beginner when you don\u0026rsquo;t understand anything I self-studied German to B1 before speaking for the first time Starting to output (speak and write) Building confidence writing and speaking Taking the Goethe B2 exam I moved to Austria and took my first German class at C1 level Was the course worth it? Takeaway: A high level in a new language is possible in a few years of \u0026ldquo;not really doing much actually\u0026rdquo; Normal, chaotic, and busy people can learn German I allude vaguely to how I learned German in a lot of my posts and tweets, but I never sat down and put the story together all in one place, until now.\nThis is the story of how I learned German from zero to C1* in about three years of unplanned, mostly unsupervised, and totally chaotic self study that mostly involved listening to podcasts and reading for pleasure.\nMy goal here is to show you that learning a new language to a high level doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a hardcore study plan, organization scheme, or intense regime of traditional group classes.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re chaotic and can\u0026rsquo;t stick to routines — I can\u0026rsquo;t — you can still do it. If you\u0026rsquo;re busy adult with a real life, you can still do it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a walking disaster zone with close to zero organizational ability and a serious allergy to structured routine. I still managed to pull it off.\nAll you really need is a few years, headphones, and a bunch of dead time: a commute, chores to do, meals to cook, laundry to fold, or whatever mindless tasks make you think you don\u0026rsquo;t have time for a language in the first place.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of languages. Your brain will do most of the heavy lifting of learning for you if you just get out of the way and let it work.\nBoost your Immersion with New Recommendations for German Media Each Week!\nI learned German using comprehensible input, which in practice meant listening to podcasts and audiobooks, watching TV, and reading for fun. Comprehensible input is language input you can mostly understand but not entirely. It also lets you turn dead time into language learning time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I write a free newsletter for German learners recommending great new German media for comprehensible input learning every week.\nWant in? You can sign up here:\nThank you to Elliot and Ian for their emails asking about my story. They\u0026rsquo;re the reason I wrote this post. If there\u0026rsquo;s something else you\u0026rsquo;re curious about or would like to see on the blog, just shoot me an email — given the small readership your odds are pretty good that I\u0026rsquo;ll write what you ask for ;)\n*I haven\u0026rsquo;t taken the C1 exam, but I was at the top of my C1 class and I ace C1 practice tests, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty confident saying that this is where I\u0026rsquo;m at now.\nWhy I started learning German I started learning German during my last year of my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree. It was basically an accident and happened thanks to a class on the history of English and a job in Denmark.\nMy undergraduate university required science students to take a handful of elective courses in English or history. A professor I\u0026rsquo;d previously taken a class from that I enjoyed was teaching a class on the \u0026ldquo;History of the English Language\u0026rdquo; and I signed up.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but something about Old English just enthralled me. I loved how it\u0026rsquo;d smoosh words together to make kennings, I loved learning about grammatical case for the first time, I loved its sound. I wanted more.\nBut\u0026hellip; Duolingo doesn\u0026rsquo;t have Old English. So I settled for German as the next best thing.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how I started. I kept going because I landed a 9-month job in Denmark. Danish has only 5.5 million or so native speakers and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty dang difficult to find good Danish-learning resources for free online.\nMeanwhile, German is swimming in resources, has something like 90 million native speakers, and it\u0026rsquo;s related to Danish — my thinking was that learning German would be easier and more useful now and also would help me pick up Danish later if I ended up staying in Denmark (I didn\u0026rsquo;t).\nHow I started teaching myself German as a beginner I started with Duolingo and gradually started adding resources from there over a few months. It was an organic process and I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it much or plan anything.\nThe first addition to Duolingo was the Coffee Break German podcast. I love the Coffee Break podcasts and think they\u0026rsquo;re great resources for beginners. With Duolingo and Coffee Break, I started growing my vocabulary and awareness of basic grammar enough to begin understanding bits and pieces of things in German.\nAccidentally starting to learn with comprehensible input Sometime in the first few months, I started looking for German music. With Spotify\u0026rsquo;s help I stumbled into the German-language \u0026ldquo;medieval folk\u0026rdquo; scene (as will happen if one plays a lot of Dungeons and Dragons and listens to playlists called stuff like \u0026ldquo;Tavern Jams\u0026rdquo;). I found a few artists I liked and started bingeing them. Nowadays I don\u0026rsquo;t listen to them much\u0026hellip; because I know enough German to find the lyrics cringe. Such is the price of progress.\nI after a few months of Duolingo and Coffee Break German, I was curious about how well I could understand a German TV series. I tried out Dark on Netflix.\nI absolutely was not \u0026ldquo;ready\u0026rdquo; for a show like Dark. Back then, I was not even really A1. I got maybe 10-20% of what I heard — English cognates and visual context help.\nThe more I listened and watched, the more I understood. It became addictive, especially at the beginning when my progress was so clear. So I kept listening more and more and more, and became more aggressive about seeking out media in German\nBut the show was still so cool. I wanted to watch it. I wanted to understand it. And I really didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to do — all my friends graduated a year before me so I spent most of my time just laying around at home alone.\nSo I binged Dark with English subtitles and then re-watched it in German with German subtitles two or three times. And then I started to do the same thing with other shows.\nI soon began doing something similar with podcasts and YouTube videos, too. I found podcasts in slow, clear German like Slow German mit Annik Rubens and News in Slow German and listened through the episode catalogues multiple times.\nIt got to a point where I had something (usually a podcast, song, or YouTube video) in German going in my ears pretty much at all times when I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be thinking in English. Commuting, doing chores, cooking — any repetitive, mindless activity became German time.\nThe more I listened and watched, the more I understood. It became addictive, especially at the beginning when my progress was so clear. So I kept listening more and more and more, and became more aggressive about seeking out media in German that I could enjoy consuming despite not understanding everything perfectly.\nIt turns out that this is a legitimate learning method. I\u0026rsquo;d stumbled into learning by comprehensible input, entirely by accident.\nWhat is comprehensible input, and how do I use it to learn? Before continuing, I want to stop and explain a bit about comprehensible input and go through exactly how I use it to learn.\nComprehensible input is input (writing or speech) in your target language that you almost understand.\nIf n = whatever you understand now, comprehensible input = n + 1.\nGenerally, folks seem to think that you need to understand 80-90% of something for it to be considered comprehensible input. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where I stand on this — I definitely listened to content I barely understood at the beginning. That\u0026rsquo;s because I hate being bored.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a great explanation of comprehensible input on Steve Kaufmann\u0026rsquo;s blog.\nBecause I hate being bored, I maybe bit off more than I could chew when it came to the difficulty of the German I was listening to and reading. But in the long run I think that cultivating my love for German was more important than optimizing my input comprehension at the beginning.\nHow to use comprehensible input as a beginner when you don\u0026rsquo;t understand anything I won\u0026rsquo;t lie, it is tricky to find good comprehensible input as a beginner. Because you understand so little, sitting through a new German TV show can be absolutely torturous. Beginner resources are easier to understand but they\u0026rsquo;re also often rather boring.\nMy mom started learning German recently and this was a big problem for her. So I sat down and tried to think through the comprehensible input tricks that I figured out by accident when I was a total beginner.\nYou have to be a little creative, but there\u0026rsquo;s no witchcraft to using input to learn German as a total newbie. If you\u0026rsquo;re struggling, I wrote up 11 tips to help beginners learn with comprehensible input from the start based on my experience. Just follow the link to get the tips sheet for free.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to discover new, authentic (not for learners!) German media to use for comprehensible input, I\u0026rsquo;ll plug my recommendations newsletter again: I write a little newsletter with a fresh German media recommendation every week. It\u0026rsquo;s also free!\nI self-studied German to B1 before speaking for the first time From 0 to B1, my German study \u0026ldquo;routine\u0026rdquo; was no routine at all — just controlled chaos.\nI filled pretty much every spare moment I had with German comprehensible input. Somewhere along the way, I discovered that \u0026ldquo;comprehensible input\u0026rdquo; was a thing — that real second language acquisition researchers really thought that learning this way could work — and that encouraged me to keep going.\nPodcasts and audiobooks were critical. I really think they\u0026rsquo;re the only way to rack up enough hours of input to learn well if you have a normal life and a normal load of chores and obligations.\nI figured out pretty early that I could understand German content about science particularly well thanks to my familiarity with the topics and to the significant overlaps in German and English scientific vocabulary. German science YouTube channels were a large source of my input (and still are). If you\u0026rsquo;re also a science nerd, check out my list of 10 great German science YouTube channels.\nPodcasts and audiobooks were critical. I really think they\u0026rsquo;re the only way to rack up enough hours of input to learn well if you have a normal life and a normal load of chores and obligations.\nWhen I headed to Denmark in September of 2019, I let my study slide. I did a bit of Duolingo here and there, but I got sidetracked trying to learn Danish. I took Danish classes at the university.\nBy the time COVID-19 sent me back to the US in 2020, I was sub-A1 in Danish and had slacked on German for months.\nQuarantined in Tucson and bored out of my mind, I crawled back to my old boredom antidote: German. I started experimenting with making Anki decks and started this blog.\nI\u0026rsquo;m actually super proud of my Anki template, even though I don\u0026rsquo;t use Anki anymore. Here\u0026rsquo;s my post all about my my Anki template for German with automatic color-coding for noun gender and irregular verbs. There\u0026rsquo;s a link to download the template in that post (but read a bit about it first, Anki can be confusing!).\nAnd about a month into lockdown, I booked my first lesson with an iTalki community tutor.\niTalki makes it easy to book private online language lessons with tutors from around the world (Note: This is an affiliate link. iTalki gives me a small cut of your lesson fee if you sign up using my link. There\u0026rsquo;s no extra cost to you). I relied on iTalki heavily when I was learning German and I\u0026rsquo;m still using it every week to meet with my amazing Italian tutor.\nOn iTalki, community tutors are people without teaching credentials who you can pay to help you out with a language. There are also professional teachers, but they often cost more. I pay for a professional teacher for Italian since I\u0026rsquo;m a beginner, but I started at a good level in German and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel I needed a pro — I just needed someone to talk to!\nStarting to output (speak and write) By this point, about 1.5 years into learning German, I was somewhere around a B1 level. And I had never spoken German with anyone.\nI could listen to and read the news without trouble and had clawed my way through the first few books of the Harry Potter series — the first novels I read in German. I enjoyed YouTube channels and podcasts made for native speakers. I was clearly ready to start communicating.\nAnd it isn\u0026rsquo;t like I didn\u0026rsquo;t have opportunities to speak. I knew a few German-speakers at that point — and I was even carrying on a long distance relationship with my partner, who is Austrian.\nBut I was too embarrassed to try in front of anyone. Perfectionism paralyzed me and kept me from talking\nGetting a tutor was really the only way I could work up the nerve to speak at the beginning. It took so much pressure off to know that she was literally getting paid not to judge me.\nBuilding confidence writing and speaking My iTalki lessons quickly became a regular part of my week, with a few months of interruption here and there when I\u0026rsquo;d move or travel back and forth between the US and Denmark (to visit my partner). I\u0026rsquo;d say I averaged something like one lesson every two weeks over the following year.\nUp through B2, I continued learning German almost exclusively using comprehensible input. The only significant change was that I started to try and do some output in German — writing or speaking — at least once a week. I barely did any structured \u0026ldquo;studying\u0026rdquo; at all.\nAt the end of the day, structured language studying is like a fork. It can help you eat, but at the end of the day you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to put some food on it if you want to digest anything.\nI kept booking conversation practice lessons with iTalki tutors and eventually added language exchange to the mix. I found a German exchange partner through MyLanguageExchange.com and we\u0026rsquo;ve been meeting every couple of weeks to chat since then, and I found an in-person German exchange partner at my new university once I started my Masters in Autumn 2020.\nEventually, all this speaking with sympathetic partners got me over (or mostly over) my embarrassment about speaking German in front of native speakers. I started speaking a bit with my partner. But he\u0026rsquo;s stubborn and likes English, and the German I did learn from him was all deepest Austrian dialect\u0026hellip; which sometimes actually hurts more than it helps when it came to grammar. Talking in front of him and his family was a big motivation boost, though.\nFor writing practice, I\u0026rsquo;d occasionally have my iTalki tutors correct journal entries in German or upload writing to LangCorrect.com for corrections. I also wrote to a few penpals via Speakly. Here\u0026rsquo;s a post I wrote with some ideas for different ways to get writing practice.\nBack when I was still using Anki (a phase lasting about 4 months), I\u0026rsquo;d turn my corrected writing mistakes into Anki flashcards to remember the corrections.\nMy \u0026ldquo;studying\u0026rdquo; phases were always rather short and never lasted longer than a few weeks. I have trouble sticking to plans. I don\u0026rsquo;t have trouble listening to podcasts.\nTaking the Goethe B2 exam I\u0026rsquo;d say the \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; of my intermediate phase came around when I took the Goethe B2 exam, because not long after that I moved to Austria and that obviously changed how I learn German significantly.\nI already wrote a post about how I studied for the exam (spoiler alert: I did not study much). But long story short, I spent about 8 hours spread over 2 weeks prepping by doing practice speaking tasks with my iTalki tutor and running through a few practice exams.\nI passed with a great score thanks to the years of comprehensible input that came before the exam prep. The prep was just to learn how to take the test. I really don\u0026rsquo;t recommend cramming for language exams — take the exam at the level you\u0026rsquo;re at now, not the level you can fake for a day with a ridiculous study schedule.\nI moved to Austria and took my first German class at C1 level I moved to Austria in the summer of 2022, which was a big change to my German routine in two ways:\nIt turned daily life into comprehensible input It forced me to output more. WAY more. Handling all the bureaucracy for the move — all in German — really pushed me over the threshold of not giving a sh** anymore if I make mistakes when I talk to people. When moving means you need 20 German-only forms signed by 100 different German-speaking bureaucrats and doctors and bankers and whatever, there\u0026rsquo;s not much time to waste being embarrassed.\nI also make a point to put myself in situations where I am forced to speak German and interact with locals rather than simply staying in the international bubble (and there\u0026rsquo;s a great international bubble in Graz). And at those international bubble gatherings, I try to stick in the German-speaking groups even though there\u0026rsquo;s always. the option to use English.\nI joined a gym, I go to \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; meetups organized by locals instead of only international events, and I\u0026rsquo;ve used language exchange Facebook groups to find Austrians to exchange with in person — I try for at least one exchange each week. I also tell my partner\u0026rsquo;s friends not to switch to English when I\u0026rsquo;m around.\nI also took my first German class: a 3-week C1 level intensive course at the local university organized primarily for international students. The class is 100% in German and the teacher shamed me enough times for speaking English with some of the other students after class that I don\u0026rsquo;t do it anymore (it was hilarious shaming, I love this teacher).\nWas the course worth it? I\u0026rsquo;d say the intensive course was worth it, mostly because it made me aware of (and better at using) some of the grammar I could already use correctly half of the time thanks to comprehensible input. Having a bit more formal study basically reinforced and clarified what I\u0026rsquo;d already learned.\nAlso, it made me a better writer. Written German is quite different from spoken German (there are entire verb tenses that almost exclusively show up in written texts) and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had too much writing practice before. I wrote a lot for the course and that was a big help.\nAnother important thing about the course is that it cleared up some of the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; things I learned thanks to lots of input in dialect\u0026hellip; I now have an easier time keeping standard German and dialect separate, even though it\u0026rsquo;s still harder for me to speak standard German correctly when the person I\u0026rsquo;m talking to responds in dialect.\nTakeaway: A high level in a new language is possible in a few years of \u0026ldquo;not really doing much actually\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s hard to sum up my method succinctly, because it\u0026rsquo;s really just super chaotic. That\u0026rsquo;s the point. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a plan and not much intentionality besides making a habit out of listening to German podcasts.\nBut if you are looking for a summary, I think one of my readers put it best when he wrote this in an email to me earlier this month:\nI think in general what I appreciated most on your blog was seeing someone reach a proficient level in the target language at a reasonable, steady pace and whilst having fun. Most B2 videos are boasting about their 3-6 month super, intensive method, but I had the feeling that it should be attainable with 2 years of not really doing much actually. Finding someone like yourself who had gone and done that was massively reassuring.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s exactly it: I learned German in about 2 years of not really doing much actually.\nYou can start learning with comprehensible input from day 1. You just need to be stubborn and learn to deal with not understanding everything. I\u0026rsquo;ll make one last pitch for my tip sheet for beginners learning with comprehensible input: I made it to help my (very monolingual) mom get started with German and I hope it will help you too.\nMy hope is that reading this might inspire some of you to give language learning a shot — or to keep trying — even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do much of anything.\nAt the end of the day, structured language studying is like a fork. It can help you eat, but at the end of the day you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to put some food on it if you want to digest anything.\nAnd even if it\u0026rsquo;s a bit messy, personally, I think it\u0026rsquo;s way more fun to eat with your hands.\n","date":"September 27, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/how-i-learned-german-to-c1-using-immersion-despite-being-busy-and-disorganized/","tags":["Comprehensible Input","German exam","Language learning tips","Teach yourself a language","Language self-study","Learn German"],"title":"How I self-taught German to C1 using immersion — despite being busy and disorganized"},{"categories":["Language Diary","Italian","German"],"contents":"This blog is all about embracing chaos and imperfection so I think it\u0026rsquo;s completely in character that I try, yet again, to get a regular language log going despite previous failures.\nThe thing about previous failures is that they sometimes turn out to be learning experiences in hindsight, once you\u0026rsquo;ve figured out to do the thing you previously failed out. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what happened to me with time tracking.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to track my language learning time forever, but I just could never figure out a method that worked for me. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to find enough little tricks to make it just enough easier that I actually manage do it.\nThis is just a long winded way of saying: here is my latest attempt at a language diary\u0026hellip; now with stats!\nLanguage Diary 3 — September 21, 2022\nActive: German (~C1) and Italian (~A2)\nDabbling: Croatian (A0)\nOn hold: Spanish (~A1)\nRIP: Danish (~A1)\nGerman (C1) - 25 hours, 59 minutes Started learning: Spring 2019 Start of latest study period: Spring 2019 Learning aides: Intensive course 3hrs per day, 5x per week Language exchange meetup 1x weekly Tandem partners ~ 1x every 1.5 weeks Natural input and output: Eine Geschichte der Welt in 100 Mikroorganismen by Florian Freistetter and Helmut Jungwirth (Book) Servus. Grüezi. Hallo. (Podcast) German dub of Love, Death, and Robots (Series) Each of the ~1 gzhillion secretaries I\u0026rsquo;ve had to talk to on the phone about some bureaucracy thing since moving to Austria Italian (A2) - 2 hours, 22 minutes Started learning: January 2022 Start of latest study period: August 2022 Learning aides: iTalki class 1x weekly Homework from iTalki class Italiano Bello (Comprehensible Input Podcast) Natural input and output: Il Cambiamento (Podcast) Croatian (A0) - 6 minutes Started dabbling September 2022 German with a side of German These last three weeks have been all about German. Moving to Austria was a big kick in the butt to focus once more on my first, best, and favorite target language. As German is now my primary target language, Italian has accordingly been moved to the back burner. Spanish is still on hold (i.e., I\u0026rsquo;m not working on it at all).\nWhen you look at my data for the past week, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that German was my priority. Between last Wednesday and this Tuesday, I logged nearly 26 hours of German and just two and a half hours of Italian. There are 6 minutes of Croatian in there, too (the Drops app). I\u0026rsquo;m kind of dabbling it, but not with much focus. The idea is just to get a bit familiar with the sounds and learn a few words now in preparation for learning it for real sometime in the next few years.\nMost of my German hours are from lessons — my intensive course, which is 3 hours a day every weekday. I\u0026rsquo;ve also upped my German podcast intake and started reading a book (Eine Geschichte der Welt in 100 Mikroorganismen by Florian Freistetter and Helmut Jungwirth) and deprioritized Italian comprehensible input accordingly.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be all German German German for a while here until I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s no language barrier between me and all these Austrians I so desperately want to like me.\nHonestly I\u0026rsquo;m good enough right now to get by socially, and if I were at this level in Italian I\u0026rsquo;d have moved on to another language already. But there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done before my conversations in German are as seamless as I expect them to be given that I\u0026rsquo;ll be living in this country hopefully for the rest of my life.\nWhat about Speakly? Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve been slacking on my Speakly. For both German and Italian. What can I say, I\u0026rsquo;ve been so drowned in stupid little phone tasks thanks to all the bureaucracy I need to deal with for the move to Austria that I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any additional time looking at the little screen.\nLogged Time for September 14–20 Data for Wednesday September 14 – Tuesday September 20\nData for Monday September 5 (start of tracking) until today, Wednesday September 21\nAs you can see in the data, I narrowed my focus to German a bit more narrowly as the month progressed. This week is much more German-heavy than the rest of September was.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the point of time tracking? After many, many failed attempts at time tracking, I finally got it working. As a chronically chaotic individual, it took a combination of iOS shortcuts and intentional choices about what\u0026rsquo;s on my phone screen to lower the activation barrier for language tracking enough that I\u0026rsquo;d actually do it.\nLong story short, you can set up iOS shortcuts to automatically start and stop Toggl trackers when you open and close certain apps. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to add fancy dropdown menus and such to select languages.\nI wrote a post last week all about time tracking for the time tracking challenged, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nSo anyways, now I have pie charts. Yay! What\u0026rsquo;s the point?\nWell, right now I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;re particularly illuminating. I\u0026rsquo;m not following my normal learning method at the moment so they don\u0026rsquo;t tell me much about how I usually learn. But I think that, in general, there\u0026rsquo;s much to be gained by using time tracking as a language learner — especially as a self-taught one.\nTime tracking lets you set time-based goals instead of outcome-based ones, which works better for language learning. Language learning is a weird and nebulous process that scientists still don\u0026rsquo;t really understand. Setting specific outcome-based goals like \u0026ldquo;correctly use 80% of German irregular verbs\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t practical and doesn\u0026rsquo;t play nice with the meandering paths our brains often take when acquiring a new language. Time-based goals, on the other hand, are a great fit for language learning and time tracking facilitates setting and measuring these goals.\nTime tracking makes your priorities clear_._ Time tracking doesn\u0026rsquo;t lie (unless you put in the data wrong). It shows you exactly how you\u0026rsquo;re prioritizing your target languages and other activities, if you track them. Especially for people learning many languages, it can be useful to understand how picking up additional languages eats into the time you spend on the ones you\u0026rsquo;re most eager to learn — or doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nTime tracking reveals your language learning method — and therefore makes it easier to tweak it. This is ultimately the reason I want to time track. As someone who writes a language learning blog, I want to know exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m doing so I can recommend it to others if it works well (and write words of warning if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t). I specifically want to know how much time I spend consuming comprehensible input since that\u0026rsquo;s the main way I learn. Time tracking makes it easier to know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and facilitates tweaking things if your method isn\u0026rsquo;t working well.\nTime tracking lends a sense of satisfaction to learning primarily via comprehensible input. Learning primarily via input has tons of advantages, but easily measured progress is not one of them. It can be frustrating to feel like you\u0026rsquo;ve consumed tons of media but still can\u0026rsquo;t tell if you\u0026rsquo;ve improved at all in your target language. Time tracking makes your efforts to learn via comprehensible input measurable and lends a sense of achievement to what would otherwise just be listening to podcasts or reading books.\nWhat do you like about time tracking? Do you track your language learning time? Or do you think it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort? I\u0026rsquo;m curious what you all think about this and whether you\u0026rsquo;ve found any helpful tricks to make tracking easier or more useful.\nDrop your ideas in the comments below or, as always, simply shoot me email or DM to get in touch!\nUntil next (probably) week\n","date":"September 20, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/language-log-3/","tags":["Teach yourself a language","Organization","Language Learning Tech","Learn italian","Learn German","Language Classes","Comprehensible Input","Beginner language learning","Advanced language learning"],"title":"Language Diary 3: Now with tracked time data!"},{"categories":["German","Opinion and Analysis"],"contents":"I recently had conversation with my German teacher about gendern — an attempt at making the heavily gendered German language more inclusive of women and sometimes also of other genders.\nEvery word in German has grammatical gender. Most words for people like \u0026ldquo;doctor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;actor\u0026rdquo; have a feminine version used for women and a masculine version used for men — and as a \u0026ldquo;generic masculine\u0026rdquo; for mixed groups of men and women and to refer to the concept in general.\nTo gendern means to use both the masculine and feminine versions of German words for people instead of the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; masculine. Directly translated to English, it\u0026rsquo;d be like saying \u0026ldquo;male astronauts and female astronauts\u0026rdquo; all the time instead of just \u0026ldquo;astronauts.\u0026rdquo; This is perceived by many German speakers as more inclusive.\nI\u0026rsquo;m all for inclusive language. So it might sound a bit strange that I really, really don\u0026rsquo;t like to gendern.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t because I think women should just roll over and accept male dominance in language — I consider myself a feminist. It\u0026rsquo;s also not (only) because gendern makes German sentences so clunky that practically nobody bothers with it casual speech.\nNope: I don\u0026rsquo;t like to gendern because it runs just about exactly opposite to how I\u0026rsquo;m used to handling inclusive language in English.\nOf course, my German teacher, a native German speaker from Austria, feels differently. To her, not using the feminine forms feels like erasing women from existence.\nI found this mismatched perception fascinating and wanted to dig into it a bit more. This post explains what gendern is in German, why people do it, and why it short-circuits my anglophone brain — but still do it anyways.\nCrash course in German grammatical gender In German, all nouns are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. The words for \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;a/an\u0026rdquo; as well as adjectives and adverbs all change depending on a word\u0026rsquo;s gender.\nThe gender of words for people almost always lines up with the biological sex of the person being talking about. Women get feminine nouns, men get masculine ones. This means it\u0026rsquo;s basically impossible to talk about someone without bringing their sex into the conversation.\nFor specific people this isn\u0026rsquo;t usually an issue because their sex is known — but start taking about \u0026ldquo;doctors,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;politicians,\u0026rdquo; or other groups of people in general and things get tricky, fast.\nThe generic masculine The problem is rather straightforward: German words for people are almost always masculine in their base or \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; form.\nTo talk about a female doctor, artist, or murderer, you\u0026rsquo;d need to change the masculine generic form by adding the suffix -in and sometimes making some other small changes.\nHere are a few examples:\nThe doctor: der Arzt (masculine), die Ärztin (feminine), die Ärzte (plural masculine), die Ärztinnen (plural feminine) The artist: der Kunstler (masculine), die Kunstlerin (feminine), die Kunstler (plural masculine), die Kunstlerinnen (feminine) The murderer: der Mörder (masculine), die Mörderin (feminine), die Mörder (plural masculine), die Mörderinnen (plural feminine)\nMark Twain famously complained about this in his essay The Awful German Language:\nA German speaks of an Englishman as the ENGLÄNDER; to change the sex, he adds INN, and that stands for Englishwoman\u0026ndash; ENGLÄNDERINN. That seems descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: \u0026ldquo;die Engländerinn,\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;which means \u0026ldquo;the she-Englishwoman.\u0026rdquo; I consider that that person is over-described.\nAs women started to adopt traditionally masculine roles, the plural masculine form was used to refer to both groups of only men and to mixed groups. If you know Spanish, French, or another Romance language, you probably can tell where this is going. For doctors:\nA male doctor: Arzt (masculine, singular) A female doctor: Ärztin (feminine, singular) A group of doctors that is\u0026hellip;\n100 men: Ärzte (masculine, plural) 50 woman + 50 men: Ärzte (masculine, plural) 99 women + 1 man: Ärzte (masculine, plural) 100 women: Ärztinnen (feminine, plural) The masculine form is also used to represent concepts in general — basically whenever sex is unknown or irrelevant. This use is the generic masculine.\nFor instance, to speak about the concept of \u0026ldquo;doctor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;doctors,\u0026rdquo; or about some undetermined doctor whose gender isn\u0026rsquo;t known or important, you\u0026rsquo;d use the masculine Arzt or Ärzte (plural) — even if you don\u0026rsquo;t only have males in mind.\nBut while masculine words can include women (i.e., either in mixed groups or referring in general to groups to which women can belong), their feminine counterparts almost always refer only to women and cannot by any stretch of the imagination include men.\nBasically, masculine is to rectangle as feminine is to square — masculine words describe the general category to which the feminine special cases belong.\nConfused? Maybe this helps:\nThe concept \u0026ldquo;doctors\u0026rdquo; in general: Ärzte (masculine, plural) The concept of \u0026ldquo;female doctors\u0026rdquo; in general: Ärztinnen (feminine, plural) The concept of \u0026ldquo;doctor\u0026rdquo; in general: Arzt (masculine, singular) The concept of \u0026ldquo;female doctor\u0026rdquo; in general: Ärztin (feminine, singular) Because the masculine is generic, to talk about \u0026ldquo;male doctors\u0026rdquo; specifically, you\u0026rsquo;d either need to make your usage clear from context or say something like männliche Ärzte — male (male) doctors.\nGendern - what is it? Many German speakers rightfully feel that this system erases women, even if they\u0026rsquo;re technically \u0026ldquo;meant-together\u0026rdquo; (mitgemeint) in the generic masculine.\nThe solution is to gendern.\nGendern — from the English word \u0026ldquo;gender\u0026rdquo; — is the practice of explicitly including both the male and female forms of words for people in written, and sometimes spoken language.\nIn some cases, people also use special punctuation marks and insert pauses into their speech to include certain trans people as well.\nWhat would gendern look like in English? Directly translated into English, to gendern would mean saying things like this:\nWe are looking for an experienced male doctor or female doctor.\nThe male politicians and female politicians will vote on Thursday on whether female workers and male workers will receive a higher minimum wage.\nThe male teachers and female teachers and nonbinary teachers are on strike.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but reading sentences like that makes my anglophone brain really uncomfortable.\nWhat gendern looks like in German In German, things get even more complicated because adjectives, adverbs, and articles (the/a) all change depending on the genders of the words they describe. This means that explicitly including both forms can make sentences very long and clunky — a reason you\u0026rsquo;ll tend to see _gendern-_ed German in formal writing and official speech but not in everyday speech.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s quick comparison of short phrases using the generic masculine to the same phrases when gendern-ed.\nGeneric masculine:\nThe teacher: der Lehrer A good teacher ein guter Lehrer The teachers: die Lehrer Gendern:\nThe teacher: die Lehrerin oder der Lehrer A good teacher: eine gute Lehrerin oder ein guter Lehrer The teachers: die Lehrerinnen und Lehrer In the first case of \u0026ldquo;the teacher,\u0026rdquo; you go from 2 words to 5 and from 3 syllables to 9 when you gendern instead of using the generic masculine.\nGerman speakers use a lot of abbreviations in writing to get around the clunkiness of gendern. They also use special characters like * and : to represent nonbinary identities.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a good summary on this webpage. But here are some examples of how you\u0026rsquo;ll see gendern abbreviated in text.\nGeneric masculine:\nThe worker: der Arbeiter A good worker: ein guter Arbeiter The workers: die Arbeiter With gendern:\nThe worker (women + men): die/der ArbeiterIn The worker (+ nonbinary): _dieder Arbeiter_in OR Arbeiter:in A good worker (women + men): ein/e gut/er ArbeiterIn A good worker (+ nonbinary): _eine gut_er Arbeiter*in OR Arbeiter:in The workers (women + men): die ArbeiterInnen The workers (+ nonbinary): die Arbeiter*innen OR Arbeiter:innen My problem with gendern Although gendern is meant to make women feel included, I really don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nFor one, I really don\u0026rsquo;t like having to use special feminine versions of words for people whenever I describe myself while men get to use words that feel more neutral.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think women are lesser or that being a \u0026ldquo;woman journalist\u0026rdquo; is somehow less than being a \u0026ldquo;man journalist.\u0026rdquo; But it\u0026rsquo;s wishful thinking to insist that the feminine and masculine forms play equal roles in the German language — the masculine forms are obviously the base form. They are shorter, easier to pronounce, and simpler and the female versions are clearly derived from them and not the other way around.\nAlso, the masculine forms can be generic, while the feminine forms almost always cannot be. Men get to refer to themselves using words that, in everyday German, refer to whole categories including both men and women.\nMeanwhile, women must use the words that refer only to women. So every time I say I\u0026rsquo;m a Journalistin, it feels to me like I\u0026rsquo;m making extra effort to point out my sex in a way that a man saying he\u0026rsquo;s a Journalist doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf the masculine forms also could only refer to men, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the same imbalance. But given how wordy it is to constantly use both the male and female forms, the generic masculine isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon. It\u0026rsquo;s also just very useful to have a general word for referring to concepts like \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;murderer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;dentist\u0026rdquo; in general without needing to think of anyone specific (and their sexual biology).\nI also don\u0026rsquo;t like to gendern because I feel like it forces me to explicitly bring attention to my sex all the time even though it isn\u0026rsquo;t — and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be — relevant most of the time.\nSeriously, why should anyone be thinking about my sexual biology when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about my job? What does it have to do with anything?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see my sex as relevant in most contexts and it feels very, very weird to me to — albiet indirectly — constantly bring my sex organs into the discussion and demand that others do the same when describing groups I belong to. I do the same work as a male journalist, so why should we use different words to describe the same work?\nMy native language influences how I perceive grammatical gender in German In English, very few words for people have explicitly feminine forms. \u0026ldquo;Actor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;actress\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;waiter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;waitress\u0026rdquo; are the only common pairs that come to mind for me, though there are a few others. In the past, there were more — \u0026ldquo;doctoress\u0026rdquo; was really an English word. But most of these forms are very outdated now.\nThis means that even though the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; words for doctor, lawyer, runner, author, etc. in English used to pretty much only refer to men, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel masculine. They feel like\u0026hellip; nothing. Today, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a sex baked in.\nI think this is why using the explicitly feminine forms in German feels like it unnecessarily highlights people\u0026rsquo;s female-ness in situations where sex has nothing to do with anything — it feels backwards to me, not progressive.\nTurned around, this is also the reason saying \u0026ldquo;male nurse\u0026rdquo; in English when a nurse\u0026rsquo;s gender isn\u0026rsquo;t important feels cringe.\nOther English-speaking women seem to feel similarly and I presume this is why the trend in English has been to drop what few explicitly feminine titles that still exist (like actress) and use the same words to describe men and women whenever possible.\nUsing gender-neutral language like \u0026ldquo;police officer\u0026quot;instead of the gendered \u0026ldquo;policemen and policewomen\u0026rdquo; is considered more inclusive.\nHow I wish it worked: how German handles gender mismatch for animals German is rather stiff when it comes to gender — but it can be still be far more flexible than people give it credit for. And there\u0026rsquo;s at least one common situation in which the language rather nicely handles mismatch between grammatical and natural gender: describing animals.\nMismatch between grammatical and natural gender is common for animal words. The words for dog, fish, and bird are masculine. The words for cat, snake, and owl are feminine. The words for horse, pig, and sloth are neuter. But there are obviously female dogs, male snakes, and sexed horses in this world.\nHow does German handle this?\nThere are sex-specific versions of many animal names that people use when it is relevant. For instance, a male cat is ein Kater. These sex-specific forms is useful when talking about breeding animals or otherwise when the animal\u0026rsquo;s sex is relevant and important.\nBut in everyday speech, you\u0026rsquo;re just not going to hear people use these forms much at all, even if they\u0026rsquo;re talking about an animal whose biological sex doesn\u0026rsquo;t match up with its grammatical gender.\nInstead, the way this usually plays out in conversation when talking about an animal whose sex is known and is the opposite of its grammatical gender is something like this:\nA: Your dog (masculine) ist very cute. What breed is it (lit: he, masculine)?\nB: Thank you! She\u0026rsquo;s (feminine) a German Shepherd (masculine).\nA: Stranger: She\u0026rsquo;s (feminine) really pretty. What a good girl (neuter)!\nAnd in German:\nA: Dein Hund ist sehr süß. Was für eine Rasse ist er?\nB: Danke! Sie ist ein Deutscherschäferhund.\nA: Sie ist wirklich schön. Was für ein braves Mädchen!\nWhen talking about an animal whose sex you know, you\u0026rsquo;d use the corresponding masculine or feminine pronoun to talk about them. The species name is simply the name of the category to wich the animal belongs and its grammatical gender doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to match the animal\u0026rsquo;s sex.\nSomething similar happens when you use metaphors to compare people to an inanimates object in German — you don\u0026rsquo;t change the inanimate object\u0026rsquo;s gender to match the person you\u0026rsquo;re comparing it to.\nThis is basically how I wish it would work with gendered job titles and other words for people in German.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;d look like\nA: And you, Marie (feminine name), what do you do?\nB: I\u0026rsquo;m a teacher (masculine, general \u0026ldquo;species\u0026rdquo;/type)\nA: My sisters (feminine) are also teachers (masculine, plural).\nB: Do you know more female teachers (feminine) or male teachers (masculine)?\nAnd in German:\nA: Und Sie, Marie, was machen Sie beruflich?\nB: Ich bin Lehrer\nA: Meine Schwestern sind auch Lehrer.\nB: Kennst du mehr Lehrerinnen oder Lehrer? (Or, yet weirder : Kennst du mehr weibliche Lehrer oder männliche Lehrer?)\nThe masculine base forms of words for types of people would behave like animal species names — like \u0026ldquo;species/type\u0026rdquo; categories that any person could belong to and which aren\u0026rsquo;t expected to line up with sex all the time.\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find a good solution Of course, there are excellent reasons that German speakers don\u0026rsquo;t do this, even though it\u0026rsquo;d be easier on my anglophone brain (and easier to say).\nUnlike in English, almost all German words for people have either masculine or feminine gender. Imagine if nearly every word describing a person behaved like the \u0026ldquo;actress/actor\u0026rdquo; pair.\nAnd I mean nearly every word for people, not just job titles. I jokingly called myself a \u0026ldquo;tyrant,\u0026rdquo; a Tyrann today in German class and my teacher corrected me to the feminine Tyrannin.\nBecause the feminine forms of German words for people exist and are used so often, the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; masculine form doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound generic like it does in English — it sounds masculine.\nWhile \u0026ldquo;Journalisten\u0026rdquo; sounds like journalists to me , it sounds like \u0026ldquo;male journalists, and maybe women if you remember they also exist\u0026rdquo; to many German speakers.\nTwo schools of thought on representation in language Beyond linguistic differences, this conflict seems to me like a mismatch between to different ideas of what it means to achieve gender equality.\nOn one side is the English viewpoint — equality between the sexes means using the same language to describe everyone whenever possible.\nMake everything as gender-neutral as possible. Drop whatever remaining explicitly female forms remain are and adopt the \u0026ldquo;generic\u0026rdquo; (once masculine, now widely used) forms for everyone. On the most extreme end, try not to use gendered terms even for ideas directly linked to biological sex (i.e., birthing parent instead of mother, people with testicles instead of men)\nOn the other side is the German viewpoint — equality between the sexes means both sexes are equally visible. In practice, this means explictly pointing out women who are otherwise invisibly swept into the generic masculine.\nSo, lean harder into the male/female distinction in job titles and normalize use of the female title alongside the male version. Write \u0026ldquo;we want to hire a male doctor or female doctor\u0026rdquo; and not just \u0026ldquo;we want to hire a doctor (generic masculine).\u0026rdquo; Create new feminine forms of titles that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a feminine form before, like Bundeskanzler (prime minister) — Bundeskanlzerin. Explicitly note everyone\u0026rsquo;s sex and make sure women aren\u0026rsquo;t forgotten.\nWhy I gendern, anyways I find the German philosophy on gender-inclusive language uncomfortable because it\u0026rsquo;s basically the exact opposite of the one I grew up with as an English speaker.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t feel it\u0026rsquo;s really isn\u0026rsquo;t my place to have strong opinions on what\u0026rsquo;s inclusive when I\u0026rsquo;m a \u0026ldquo;guest\u0026rdquo; in a new language. It\u0026rsquo;s all fun and games to imagine using German words for people the way animal species names work, but it\u0026rsquo;s just that — a fun thought experiment. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I\u0026rsquo;d ever try to convince anyone to adopt.\nUltimately, it\u0026rsquo;s not my opinion that matters: how German tickles my anglophone reflexes is not the point. It\u0026rsquo;s what German-speaking people feel.\nAnd I certainly understand why someone who grew up speaking a thoroughly gendered language in which the masculine clearly dominates would think \u0026ldquo;hey, isn\u0026rsquo;t it about time that you include the women for once!\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I do gendern. Even if it gives me a bit of a stomachache.\nWhat do you think? How is gender-inclusive language handled in your language? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear what you think about this. If you\u0026rsquo;re learning German, do you find gendern uncomfortable, too? How is gender-inclusive language handled in your native language or target languages? If you speak German, how well do you think the current solutions for inclusive language work in German?\nLet me know in the comments below.

This is a good question, especially since I learn through comprehensible input and time is undeniably the most important of the rather few levers one can manipulate in an input-based study \u0026ldquo;strategy.\u0026rdquo;\nUnfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any idea. People who ask usually end up receiving some totally unhelpful answer like \u0026ldquo;a lot.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like to know — I\u0026rsquo;m just quite bad at tracking time.\nThe problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that there aren\u0026rsquo;t good tools. These days there are plenty of great services built to help record every second you spend on every task imaginable. Plenty of people in the language learning community and beyond use these apps to catalogue their time with intimidating accuracy.\nSo no, the problem isn\u0026rsquo;t the tools. The problem is bothering to actually use the tools.\nI\u0026rsquo;m definitely on the chaotic side of the D\u0026amp;D alignment chart and — despite my desperate wish otherwise — am unfortunately rather allergic to organization. The only reason I can learn languages successfully is because languages are one of the few magical things in this world that don\u0026rsquo;t require focused, structured work to get good at.\nNeedless to say, it isn\u0026rsquo;t natural for me to start and stop a time tracker whenever I do anything.\nThankfully, internet strangers are far more clever than I am and someone figured out a solution that makes it practically effortless to track time, even if you\u0026rsquo;re a disorganized mess like me: iOS automations and shortcuts.\nThis post walks through how to use shortcuts to track language learning using Toggl — but you can use whatever tracker you\u0026rsquo;d like so long as it is compatible with shortcuts. There\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry. It\u0026rsquo;s not too bad and I\u0026rsquo;ve already made plenty of mistakes testing things out so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to yourself.\nSorry Android people\u0026hellip; I was one of you for years and I feel your pain.\nUse iOS Shortcuts and Automations to automatically operate a time-tracking app on your phone You can set up iOS automations to automatically start and stop your time tracking app when you open and close apps that you use to learn languages. I use Toggl as my time tracker, but there are other trackers like Clockify and Polylogger, which was built specifically for language learners. I can\u0026rsquo;t promise that other apps will work the same way as Toggl but it should be possible to use them, too.\nShortcuts are no-code programs that let you automate repetitive tasks on your iPhone. Automations are shortcuts that run when certain events or \u0026ldquo;triggers\u0026rdquo; occur — like opening a specific app. You can run shortcuts from within automations.\nFor instance, you could create an automation to automatically start a Toggl timer for Duolingo when you open the Duolingo app. Using another automation, you could automatically stop the timer once you close Duolingo.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s that simple! Your phone will do the hard work of remembering to run your shortcut for you.\nCredit where credit is due: thank you to Tanya on Twitter for the idea to use iOS automations to operate a time tracking app.\nThis way you won’t have to input stuff manually. It does get trickier if you are learning several languages, but you can create a drop-down menu of options to choose from each time you open your podcast app. This is what mine looks like — pic.twitter.com/J1vctDop5m\n\u0026mdash; Tanya | Таня | 타냐 (@botanechka) August 31, 2022 Example: Automatically track time spent listening to podcasts in your target language I listen to a lot of podcasts for language learning. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to set up an automation to track your time spent listening to podcasts in Toggl. It only works for one language — see below if you\u0026rsquo;re learning more than one.\nFirst, open the Shortcuts app and create a new automation. Set the automation to trigger when an app is opened and select your podcast app. I used Pocket Casts for this example.\nThen add a Toggl \u0026ldquo;Start Time Entry\u0026rdquo; action and set the description and project. In this example, the description is \u0026ldquo;Podcasts\u0026rdquo; and the project is \u0026ldquo;German,\u0026rdquo; because I\u0026rsquo;m learning German. You can also set a task for the time entry, assign it tags, and designate it as billable or non-billable by clicking the little blue arrow next to the project field.\nYou can then decide whether you want the automation to run automatically or to ask you first before running.\nWhat if you\u0026rsquo;re learning multiple languages? If you\u0026rsquo;re learing more than one language, you can add a step to your iOS automations that prompts you to select the language you\u0026rsquo;d like to track from a dropdown menu.\nUse the \u0026ldquo;Choose from Menu\u0026rdquo; action to set up your dropdown menu. Make an option for each language you\u0026rsquo;d like to track. Then add appropriate time tracking actions for each of the language menu options. For instance, if I select \u0026ldquo;German\u0026rdquo; from the menu, my shortcut starts a Toggl timer for \u0026ldquo;Podcasts\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;German\u0026rdquo; project.\nIf you use automations to track time in more than one app, it might be worth setting up a shortcut for choosing a language and starting an appropriate Toggl timer that you can reuse in your automations. This will save you time if you ever want to add or remove a language from your dropdown menu — instead of updating every automation, you can simply update the shared shortcut once.\nSee the example at the end of this post to get an idea of how this can work.\nUsing a shared Shortcut for selecting your language also opens up some fun options for setting up other kinds of automations and shortcuts that help with time tracking.\nFor instance, I created a button on my phone\u0026rsquo;s Home Screen that makes it easier to track language learning activities that don\u0026rsquo;t have their own app. When I tap the button, I\u0026rsquo;m prompted to choose a language (using the \u0026ldquo;Choose language\u0026rdquo; Shortcut) and then select an activity from a dropdown list. The Shortcut starts an appropriate time entry in Toggl and I use another, adjacent button to easily stop tracking once I finish.\nTips for Toggl-based shortcuts Toggl is one of the most popular time tracking apps in the language learning community and it plays nice with shortcut actions. But it also has some quirks that can make it tricky to set up more sophisticated shortcuts and automations.\nChoose from List vs Choose from Menu These two similar actions aren\u0026rsquo;t strictly Toggl-related but they work differently in ways that matter for using dropdown menus with your Toggl-based time tracking automations.\nChoose from List prompts you to select from a list of options and passes the selection to actions downstream as a \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; variable. Attention! You need to set up a \u0026ldquo;List\u0026rdquo; object first before you can use it.* This confused me at first.\nChoose from Menu prompt you select from a list of options and runs different actions depending on the option you chose. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like an input followed by an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass the selected option as text to a variable that can be used downstream.\nThe Toggl Track iOS Shortcut actions Toggl has four iOS shortcut actions: Start Time Entry, Stop Time Entry, Continue Last Time Entry, and Check Reports.\nStart Time Entry starts a new timer in Toggl. It takes two required inputs: \u0026ldquo;Description\u0026rdquo; (text) and \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; (Toggl project). There are optional inputs for \u0026ldquo;Task\u0026rdquo; (Toggl project task) and \u0026ldquo;Tags\u0026rdquo; (Toggl tags) and it\u0026rsquo;s possible to designate timers as billable or non-billable time.\nStop Time Entry stops the current Toggl timer.\nContinue Time Entry re-starts the last Toggl timer you stopped.\nCheck Reports opens Toggl and shows a summary report for a given period (day, month, year, etc.).\nPassing variables to the Toggl Start Time Entry action The Toggl Start Time Entry action cannot accept text inputs to \u0026ldquo;Project,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Task,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Tags.\u0026rdquo; These fields can only be filled by selecting projects, tasks, or tags from lists your phone generates by checking your Toggl workspace.\nConfused? In practice, this means that you cannot use \u0026ldquo;Choose from List\u0026rdquo; to choose a language and pass its name to the \u0026ldquo;Project,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Task,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Tags\u0026rdquo; fields in the Toggl action. You need to use the \u0026ldquo;Choose from Menu\u0026rdquo; action and set up customized Toggl timer actions to run based on the selections.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Description\u0026rdquo; field does accept text inputs, however. This means that you can use the \u0026ldquo;Choose from List\u0026rdquo; action to set the names of your Toggl tasks.\nShould automations run automatically or ask first?\nIf you tell your automation to ask before running, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a push notification every time your automation is triggered that you can tap to run it.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually gunk up the \u0026ldquo;automatic\u0026rdquo; feel of the automations that much, and I recommend having certain automations ask before running.\nFor podcast apps, I think it makes sense to ask before starting or stopping a Toggl timer since we often open other apps while listening to podcasts. But for apps like Duolingo that we can only actively use while they\u0026rsquo;re open, it\u0026rsquo;s probably fine to just let automations run on their own.\nExample: Universal \u0026ldquo;Language Dropdown Menu\u0026rdquo; Shortcut for Toggl-Based Time Tracking Automations This is all pretty abstract, so here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how this can work. I set up a universal \u0026ldquo;Language Dropdown Menu\u0026rdquo; shortcut for my Toggl-based time tracking automations.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like:\nWhen it runs, it just opens up a dropdown menu of languages and then starts the appropriate Toggl Timer based on whatever activity it receives as input to the description field (i.e., Video, Formal Study, etc.)\nThis saves me time because I don\u0026rsquo;t need to set up dropdown menus for every shortcut I create — my automations tracking Duolingo, Speakly, and my podcast app all share the same same dropdown menu shortcut.\nShortcut inputs and automations running shortcuts\nAutomations can run shortcuts and shortcuts can take input from automations and other shortcuts. To give your shortcut an input from another shortcut or automation, use \u0026ldquo;Shortcut Input\u0026rdquo; as a variable to fill some field in your automation and select \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s Onscreen\u0026rdquo; as the source of input. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird name but it just means \u0026ldquo;whatever the other app you called this shortcut from passes into it\u0026rdquo;\nMy Toggl tracking for language learning is rather basic and only has two organizational layers — Languages (projects) and categories like Podcasts, Lessons, etc., which I set as descriptions. Toggl lets you easily search by description so I\u0026rsquo;m just consistent in my naming scheme. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to set up a more sophisticated dropdown shortcut with a lot of conditional statements if you use a more complicated system with tags and tasks.\nUse shortcuts to more easily track language learning that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve your phone Once you set them up, automations and shortcuts make it practically effortless to log the time you spend using your phone for language learning — and they can make it easier to track time you don\u0026rsquo;t spend on your phone, too.\nExample: Track Language Learning button Using shortcuts, I created a button to quickly track time spent on different types of language learning activities.\nClick here to see the shortcut.\nWhen I tap the button, it opens a dropdown menu of the different types of language learning activities I track — podcasts, video, lessons, exchange, etc. Once I select one of the options, I\u0026rsquo;m shown a dropdown menu of languages. An appropriate Toggl timer starts automatically after I\u0026rsquo;ve made my selections.\nHaving a Toggl widget on my Home Screen right next to my language tracking button is helpful to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t forget to stop the timer.\nExample Toggl Tracker Shortcuts Here are a few example shortcuts showing different ways to automatically track time spent on language learning. Let me know if you find any errors!\nDuolingo tracker with language dropdown Automation: When Duolingo opened, run this shortcut Using shared language dropdown + start Toggl tracker shortcut\nShared language dropdown + start Toggl timer shortcut Duolingo tracker using shared language dropdown menu Automation: when Duolingo opened, run this shortcut My personal podcast tracker with option for listening to English podcasts Automation: when Snipd (podcast player) opened, run this shortcut Remember to set up automations to stop your time tracker timers when you close apps!\nHow do you track your language learning time? If at all? How do you track your time spent on language learning? I\u0026rsquo;m finding that this system works great for me — great as in I am actually using it halfway effectively.\nDo you have any fun shortcuts that help you track your time? Do you use an app other than Toggl? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear about what you do differently — and quite probably better — than me!\nAnd finally, in case you\u0026rsquo;re curious\u0026hellip; here is my tracked time for the last 3 days. I\u0026rsquo;m taking a German Intensive Course right now which is why I have 3 hours of lessons in the mix (today is Monday).

Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com to learn more.\nDo you remember the moment your language became real for you? I remember my moment. It was tiny, just a few seconds, but I’ll never forget it.\nI was in Moscow, at Mendeleevskaya Metro Station, a rather famous metro station known for its bronze statue of a dog with a peculiarly shiny nose polished daily by the hands of commuters who rub it for good luck. I had to make it all the way across the city in less than an hour, before the trains would stop, and I knew I needed to take the Red Line train. But I had no idea where in the multilevel station to go.\nI clearly needed to ask someone for directions. But while I had been trying to teach myself Russian for years, I was still petrified to speak the language even now that I was finally in Russia.\nStill, I really needed to find that train. So after a few agonizing minutes of panic, I finally stopped a fairly friendly looking older woman and said, in the best Russian I could muster, “Excuse me, I need to find the Red Line, do you know where I need to go?”\nNot only was the woman kind enough to point me in the right direction, she said I spoke very well for an Englishman (close enough, I didn’t bother to correct her). All that fear and worry turned out to be for nothing.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Dack Powell (@dacktheripper)\nAs I sat on the train, I realized that I had finally done it, I had spoken my target language in-country! Not only that, I had done so successfully — I communicated well enough to be understood, and I understood what was said back to me. It was even pleasant and fun! I came away from that experience energized and motivated, and while learning Russian can certainly still be a challenge sometimes, I have grown enormously as a speaker since that day at the train station. Today, I’ve achieved a comfortable upper-intermediate, or B2 level, on the CEFR scale.\nAnd I am here to tell you: if I can do it, you can do it! I hope that my story can help encourage you, wherever you are on your language learning journey.\nIt started with a crush — on Cyrillic My first target language was Russian. I’ve had a bit of a language “crush” on it since I was a nerdy kid playing Cold War video games. For me, it was all about the Cyrillic script — it was so cool and mysterious with its unfamiliar shapes and… is that a 3!? I started teaching myself with what few resources I could find on the internet in 2008 and have had a love-hate relationship with Russian that has lasted ever since.\nWhen I started learning, I used every well-designed app I could find. After all, if it’s popular and well-designed, it must be made with some secret science sauce, right!?\nUnfortunately, that’s not really the case. For me, The Almighty Owl (Duo) was not the end-all guide to my learning, nor were Memrise, Fluent Forever, or Babbel. I gained vocabulary, and I could ask for directions, let me tell you! But at the end of the day the language was not yet “my own.” It had not worked its way down into my soul.\nFor whatever reason, no matter how much knowledge I accumulated, I couldn’t turn it into comfortability and fluency. That surprised me, after all, gaining knowledge and making it into everyday usability is natural, what gives?\nStudying only gets you so far It turns out that I was making a very common, but tragically still underappreciated mistake- I was not acquiring a language, I was studying a language.\nIn my mind now, it’s the difference between knowing all there is to know about Abe Lincoln, and being his best friend. I had the right idea about making routines and forming habits around study, but I still had a nascent understanding of how to incorporate the language into my everyday life.\nWhen I found the right courses, there was another key to learn: there are lots of good resources now that ALL work, so don’t think that you just haven’t found a resource that works yet- they all work, seriously! But being consistent and finishing a particular course or resource will help build your efficacy and readiness to tackle the next level.\nBut not matter how good a resource is, it will only take you so far. As I learned Russian, I was shocked to discover how much faster I improved once I learned to deal with my fear of messing up and just put myself out there to talk to people.\nAt first, I was terrified to speak and somehow believed that just by reading and listening, I could somehow learn enough words and grammar to start speaking fluently one day, “when I was ready.”\nReader, we are never going to be ready, and that’s fine!\nWhether you start speaking on day one or wait six months, just accept that you’re going to be uncomfortable and feel silly for a while, but it really does get better, and what surprised me most is how motivational and empowering it felt when I finally did stick with it and started speaking regularly!\nAs someone very comfortable with textbooks and classrooms, I assumed that I would accumulate enough book-knowledge to avoid being embarrassed when I spoke. That was wrong, kind of. It’s impossible not to make mistakes, but the embarrassment wasn’t ever that bad. The truth is that native speakers of your target language are often excited that you’re even trying to learn their mother tongue and are more likely to encourage you than they are to judge you. Had I known that, I think I would have saved myself a lot of wasted time and started to speak Russian spontaneously and reflexively much faster.\nThis isn’t to say that today I have a perfect language-learning routine down pat and all of that. I think that we often imagine that the goal of language learning is to one day be as comfortable in our target languages as we are in our own native tongue, and for most of us that just isn’t realistic unless you plan to relocate and build your life where the language is spoken.\nMy method still changes all the time as I find resources that mesh with me as a learner. And as a teacher, I’ve learned that every student is different: some of us like or adhere to certain materials more or less easily, so being a good student means almost being like teachers to ourselves and staying curious about what methods, resources, and habits are most effective for us.\nRather than be focused on the product of our learning, we need to learn to be focused on the process of our learning, find ways to study that are enjoyable, things that don’t feel so much like chores. When that happens, you begin to immerse yourself and assimilate the language into your being.\nPausing isn’t quitting For my part, my relationship to Russian (and to language in general) ebbs and flows like my relationship to all of my hobbies. I go through highly motivated phases and then sometimes I just sort of stop for a while. Sometimes for a long while.\nMost recently I stopped for nearly six months when I went back to school, but when I managed to reincorporate even just Anki back into my daily routine, I was so excited! So if you want to quit right now, or even if you are currently in one of those long periods where you just can’t bring yourself to study, that’s alright. Don’t build it up in your head like you’re failing somehow.\nSometimes, we just need a break. At least in my experience, coming back has been like rediscovering music, or painting, and now it’s part of my daily life again, and I hope it stays that way!\nThanks to some of these hard-learned lessons and many wonderful polyglot mentors I have encountered on the way, I am currently sitting pretty at B2 in Russian, and a fairly strong A1 in Spanish (as strong as A1 can feel, anyway!)\nB2 doesn’t mean speaking like a Russian, or easily quoting lines of classic literature as I would Shakespeare in my native English, but it’s comfortable. I listen to pop music, I read novels (Dune really should have been written in Russian originally, it’s perfect for it), I watch TV shows, and I spend hours talking to my friends. And after all, aren’t those the sorts of things we start out wanting to be able to do in our TL?\nOf course, not everyone has to spend a decade on their first foreign language. As many will tell you, learning a language gets easier with each one that you learn. That has certainly seemed to be true for me in the six months or so since I started to study Spanish. And even though I’ve spent a decade with Russian, the bulk of my meaningful learning took place within my first year and then later, over the last two years.\nBut I gained something critical in all that time: the belief that I can do it, that I can learn whatever I set my mind to. I don’t know about you, but not believing in myself has held me back more than anything else.\nAs of this post, I am still studying. Spanish is my main focus because of an impending work-related move to Barcelona this year, but I still try to make lots of calls to friends and consume Russian content regularly. My hope for Spanish is to reach B2 by the end of next year, and C1 in Russian the year after, hopefully picking up Turkish as a pet project after that.\nAfter all, I make the rules and the sky’s the limit — and the same is true for you.\nBonus: 4 pieces of advice and favorite resources As I refine my methods and study plans and try to develop my own personal routines, I think I can sum up some of my favorite lessons, which I hope will serve you, thus:\nAdjust your standards, take it easy on yourself, and enjoy the journey. Do some research to find the methods that are backed by evidence and you think you can stick with. Accept that your motivation will ebb and flow, let yourself take breaks if you need it, the language isn’t going anywhere. Enjoy the process, find the things you enjoy. The learning really will do itself. (Just ask Dr. Stephen Krashen!) And finally, maybe some of these resources can help you get through whatever slump you might be in or may be in in the future. Some are backed by scientific evidence, others are simply likable or best practice:\nGeneral language resources:\nKrashen’s theory of comprehensible input Ikenna Obi’s Fluency Made Easy method Olly Richards’ channel Zoe.language’s channel Anki spaced repetition flashcards Lingq Russian specific resources that helped me:\nRussian with Max (my favorite!)

Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com to learn more.\nMy husband and I had been trying to get to Europe for years for his job, and it was finally happening to us. We were moving to Italy. What a dream! But as friends raved about the food and wine I’d enjoy, gave recommendations for which city to see first, and silently planned their own vacations to visit us, all I could think about was the language.\nI was 33 years old, and although I’d always wanted to learn a second language, growing up in the United States, there weren’t many opportunities to do so. My first opportunity to take a foreign language course was in high school, so at 16 years old I took my first Spanish class. After four semesters studying vocab and grammar in order to pass exams, this bright-eyed, straight-A student was left disappointed with how little Spanish she could actually speak.\nBut now I would have immersion. Living in Italy was going to be my ticket to fluency in another language. I couldn’t wait to arrive and jump right in.\nOur first week in Italy was a mixture of language excitement and fear. Walking around the supermarket, I was thrilled to see words I understood because they were close my native English or to one of the few words I remembered from Spanish class all those years earlier. I felt a distinct thrill when saying “grazie” to a waiter. I remember passing a father and his young son at the mall and hearing, “bagno,” which I recognized as “bathroom,” and immediately turning to my 4-year-old daughter to teach her this very important word.\nThe author and her child looking out over an Italian landscape of rolling hills and vineyards. After her husband got a job in Italy, Heidi moved with her family and started learning Italian.\nYet as I eavesdropped on the conversations going on around me, I noticed that I couldn’t tell where one Italian word ended and the next began. I started to realize how much I needed to learn just to be able to order food and pay the bill in Italian. How would I ever learn enough to speak with my kids’ school teachers, go to a doctor, or make friends?\nI felt overwhelmed, but I pushed down the paralyzing fear and let my motivation to learn Italian lead the way. I found Duolingo, of course, and set to work finishing as many lessons as possible every day. There was also a local Italian as a Second Language (ISL) course offered to English speakers in my area, and I signed up as soon as I could. I often used Google Translate to look up words I saw on signs and to discover how to say certain useful phrases.\nI was eager to try out my new vocabulary everywhere I went, but the people I spoke with didn’t always meet my attempts to communicate with the same enthusiasm. In restaurants, the servers often spoke English and would promptly switch as I stumbled over proper pronunciation. At stores, I still couldn’t understand when a cashier told me the price of my goods, and transactions always took longer than they should have as I struggled to figure out the Italian numbers before finally surrendering and just checking the cash register screen to see the price.\nEvery day brought both victories and defeats. Once, in a bookstore, I asked if they carried the book “1984” and the store clerk clearly understood my question. But my fleeting moment of pride quickly waned as she responded in rapid Italian – I didn’t catch a single word. I clearly needed to do more than learn vocabulary and grammar, because just speaking the words I learned wasn’t enough to get around. I also had to understand when others spoke to me, but I had no idea how to work on that.\nAbout six months into our new Italian life, I started to feel a new, distinct feeling of being overwhelmed by the prospect of learning Italian. I was making progress, but it was slow. Much slower than I had anticipated.\nI could speak at a comfortable mid-beginner (A1) level, but I wasn’t able to express my thoughts perfectly, add my intellectual opinions to conversations, or fully understand others’ responses. It left me in a constant state of doubt and unease. I was making friends, but it was difficult for me to practice Italian with them because their English was so advanced that we always communicated in that language in order to make deeper connections. One of my daughter’s preschool teachers started asking me if we were speaking Italian at home, and I wondered if I should be able to speak fluently by now. Duolingo told me I was 25% fluent in the language (thankfully, they abandoned this metric in later years), but my day-to-day interactions with the language told me that fluency was still completely out of reach. I made so many mistakes, froze without words on my tongue, and feared judgment for my lack of conversational ability.\nTo add more pressure to an already strained situation, I was starting up graduate school courses again and had to study for the formidable comprehensive exams required for graduation. My son, 18 months old at the time, was also walking more and napping less, so I had significantly less time to study Italian (or focus on any other responsibilities, for that matter). And my daughter wasn’t speaking Italian at preschool yet, which I couldn’t help but see as a failure on my part to do more to help her.\nUnder this pressure, I decided I needed to try something new. I was desperate for anything that might force Italian into my head, so I went to an online search engine and typed in: “How to become fluent in Italian fast.”\nTo this day, I still cringe at my expectation to find the perfect program that would be responsible for my language acquisition. Yet, in my naïve desperation, I found Rocket Italian, a rather expensive self-paced program that had hundreds of reviews praising its time-effectiveness and raving about the fun users were having with their language learning. I quickly purchased lifetime access to the program, and with renewed vigor, committed myself to doing Rocket Italian lessons for at least 15 minutes every day.\nI kept this commitment to myself for about two weeks, but I didn’t find this program to be the magical tool I had expected. As with Duolingo, I started from the beginning, despite the fact that I already knew that one-third of the program would just be review for me. I completed every single task in order until I earned a 100% rating, even if the only mistake was a typing error or my microphone simply didn’t pick up my speech. Instead of pulling anything from the material that was new and interesting to me, I flew through the lessons as fast as possible just to finish them.\nProgressing in the program — finishing one lesson after another — was, to me, a sign of progressing in the language. Yet all I needed to do was step outside my home and be confronted with real-world Italian interactions to see that I wasn’t progressing as fast as I thought. I felt like I was failing.\nOver the next year, I continued searching for the perfect tool. I started listening to Italian music, obsessing over translating lyrics and trying to understand every single word. I bought Il Diario (The Diary of Anne Frank), thinking it would be an easy read and then got frustrated at the number of words and phrases I didn’t understand. I gave up on Rocket Italian because it wasn’t making me fluent, yet I ignored the fact that I’d only reviewed things I already knew and didn’t spend time internalizing the information but instead simply finishing the tasks. I tried listening to Italian podcasts in my sleep at night. I made flashcards and became fixated on drilling decks until I didn’t miss a single word.\nEven as it became clear that it wasn’t working, I kept approaching the language from an all-or-nothing, perfectionist point of view. If I didn’t understand everything, I was failing. If I didn’t remember a word, I was failing. If I was too exhausted to grind through a lesson, I was failing. If I could just do more, and do it perfectly, then I would reach the fluency that immersion was supposed to give me.\nThe author on a hike in the Italian alps.\nI reached a breaking point about two years into my journey with Italian. I was constantly stressed. And worse, I realized that my stress had started to creep into my now 6-year-old daughter’s own language challenges at school. I was so focused on my mistakes, failures, and wasted time that I doubted everything. I started to believe the lies I’d heard about language learning. I’m too old to learn a language. I don’t have the right kind of brain for it. I didn’t learn it as a child, so it’s impossible for me. I’m not gifted in languages. Immersion is only useful for young people with no other obligations.\nThis internal breaking point arrived at about the same time that COVID-19 found its way to Italy. Seemingly overnight, I went from having a few hours of quiet study each day while the kids were at school to no time alone at all while we were all locked down. Like so many others, I felt lost as I tried to figure out how to support my daughter’s schooling (in Italian) from home, maintain some sense of normalcy and sanity, and also find time for graduate school and language study.\nIt was all too much, and I finally acknowledged that I simply couldn’t continue as I was. Something had to give. But instead of quitting or putting tasks aside, I decided to set aside my perfectionism.\nI realized that the problem wasn’t me or the resources I’d tried. The problem was my expectations.\nGoing back to the very beginning of my journey with Italian, I expected immersion to make me fluent automatically. I expected to see fast progress, preferably being “fluent” in one year. I didn’t expect to make mistakes once I’d learned something. I expected others to be patient and slow down their spoken language for me. I expected Duolingo, Italian classes, Rocket Italian, and every other tool to give me the language. I definitely expected too much of myself. I thought I could do it all – language study, grad school, parenting, travel, friendships — and now, in lockdown, being my children’s Italian teacher. And in all of this, I allowed no room for errors.\nIn the 2+ years since lockdown began in 2020, I’ve seen more progress with Italian (and now with German!) and more personal growth than I ever truly thought possible. Confronting and changing my expectations were the only magical tools I needed. Not only did I stop expecting perfection of myself, but I also allowed myself to see the flaws in the way I had been approaching language learning.\nCompleting the Duolingo tree or flying through a Rocket Italian lesson wasn’t proof of progress, and in operating this way, I was completely missing the point – the language itself. Being afraid of making mistakes cost me the experience of having interactions with others, and it left me focusing inward instead of appreciating the connections I was making with the amazing people around me. Thinking I should be able to do more, speak more, and understand more only reinforced a fixed, never-good-enough mindset.\nOverhauling my expectations worked. No longer fearing mistakes, I’ve stepped out of my comfort zone and maintained frequent conversation lessons online in Italian. I’ve jumped at every opportunity to practice my beginner-level German since moving from Italy to Germany one year ago.\nRealizing that the intentional time I spend studying a language is more effective than simply completing tasks, I’ve returned to some of my original resources (such as Rocket Italian, Duolingo, reading Italian books, and listening to Italian podcasts), and I use them in a way that’s beneficial to me, studying with purpose and squeezing from them what I need. I’ve discovered other resources and books with no expectation of them making me fluent, and I guiltlessly set aside anything that just doesn’t work for me, my personality, my time, or my goals.\nThe difference has been incredible. Not only am I speaking Italian at an intermediate level and understanding even better, but I’ve also discovered deeper relationships with the native Italian speakers in my life, connected with other language learners working to define their own language paths, and set a healthy and realistic standard for approaching knowledge and education that my kids are emulating.\nIt’s not perfect. I still struggle with feeling overwhelmed by language learning, especially as I realize how much more there is to learn. I still have a voice in my head telling me that I’m too old or not talented at languages. I make mistakes and get frustrated with them. But the new version of myself – the one that sets realistic expectations, focuses on what I have accomplished, and knows what I’m capable of – that version always wins now. She grounds me. She speaks positivity. She moves forward with her head held high.\nAiming for perfection was hard. It gave me a false sense of achievement and stirred up destructive spirals of self-doubt and self-loathing that eroded my mental health and held up real progress. Learning to aim for “good enough” was somehow harder – until it wasn’t. It took time and conscious effort, but shifting my mindset worked. “Good enough” turned out to get a lot closer to “perfect” than perfection ever could.\nHeidi Lovejoy is a U.S. American living abroad with her husband and two children since 2017.

Grüezi. Hallo.) even though I\u0026rsquo;ve already listened through at twice. I know people who spend hours every day doing workbook exercises. In school, I drove myself nuts memorizing tables of verb conjugations. And a lot of us have phones crowded with apps that have us learn sentences like \u0026ldquo;she has the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\nAll that makes it easy to forget that language learning is actually pretty natural for humans. And recent research shows that the neural circuits that we use to process language as an adult seem to start doing their jobs just hours after birth.\nResearchers from Shenzhen University in China recently published a study in Nature Human Behavior showing that newborn babies can be taught to better distinguish natural vowel sounds from the same sounds played backwards within just hours of birth. Infants do this using brain areas that are known to be associated with human speech — and they don\u0026rsquo;t get better at noticing the backwards vowels, which is a good sign that we\u0026rsquo;re born hard-wired to use our language-learning circuits for language and not for meaningless auditory garbage.\nNewborns recognize speech sounds, but do they learn them? And how? Babies start life already tuned-in to human speech. Newborns respond differently to human speech than to other noises, and they can distinguish their mom\u0026rsquo;s voice from other female voices.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also clear that babies start the more sophisticated task of distinguishing different phonemes — the individual sounds that make up human speech — very early, within the first few hours or days of life. But it\u0026rsquo;s still not settled whether phoneme recognition is something we\u0026rsquo;re born with or something that we start learning shortly after birth.\nThe evidence isn\u0026rsquo;t clear one way or the other. Hearing organs come online at around 24 weeks of gestation, and there is some interesting work showing that newborns come into the world already preferring the sounds of their native language over foreign ones. This would suggest that the infant brain comes pre-installed with phoneme recognition. However, another study found that while newborns can distinguish between simple vowels right after birth, they only start picking up the differences between trickier sounds after training.\nWatching newborn brains learn language Innate or learned, phoneme recognition clearly starts early. But exactly how that recognition plays out in the infant brain wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear — do newborns have a unique way of processing speech, or do their brains already respond to human language the way adult brains do?\nTo find out, researchers measured the brain activity of infants to see if — and how — they could distinguish between natural vowel sounds in their native language, Mandarin, and the same vowels played backwards.\nNerd Alert: How measuring brain activity works\nThe researchers in this study used a very cool method called Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to track brain activity, and the nerd in me just couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist giving a quick explanation. Skip this if you don\u0026rsquo;t care.\nIn a nutshell, fNIRS works by shining light into the brain and seeing how much comes back. In this study, each baby was fit with a cap containing a network of tiny light sensors called optodes, each of which is either red or blue. The red optodes shine near-infrared light into the scalp, which passes harmlessly through human tissue until it bounces back out. The blue optodes measure how much light makes it out of the brain.\nBecause active brain areas need more oxygen and because fresh, oxygen-loaded blood absorbs lots of near-infrared light, scientists can measure brain activity by watching how much light from the red optodes makes it to the blue ones.\nCool, right?\nThe researchers \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo; 25 babies to recognize a set of 3 vowels (/ɑː/, /ɔː/ and /iː/) by having them listen to 10-minute recordings of the same vowel sound played forward and then backwards for 5 hours. After training, the babies took a \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; — the scientists played recordings of the vowels they had \u0026ldquo;learned\u0026rdquo; both forwards and backwards and watched how their brain activity responded. 2 hours after the 1st test, the babies took the same test again.\nFor reference, the researchers also gave the same two tests to 25 babies that had \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo; on vowels that didn\u0026rsquo;t show up in the test (what scientists call an \u0026ldquo;active control\u0026rdquo;) or not trained at all (a \u0026ldquo;passive control\u0026rdquo;).\nBabies\u0026rsquo; brains have a little spike in activity after hearing sounds. If that peak is stronger and faster for natural vowels than it is for backwards vowels, that\u0026rsquo;s a good indication that babies can distinguish between the two. So by comparing the speed and strength of those post-vowel spikes, the researchers could compare how quickly the different training groups responded to natural vs unnatural vowel sounds.\nTraining and testing took about 8 hours — something I have to say sounds tough considering these babies had just been born and had to spend that time away from their parents. Parents were compensated for participating in the study and gave written informed consent to participate, and babies that cried were excluded from the study and returned to their parents early.\nThe language grind starts on day 0 The results seemed to show that — not even a day after birth — babies\u0026rsquo; brains are hard at work learning to distinguish specific speech sounds, and that their brains learn using neural circuitry similar to the adult language-processing system.\nBefore training, none of the babies were very good at distinguishing vowel sounds. This was unexpected because previous studies have shown that babies are born with at least some ability to recognize speech, and the researchers think that it might be because fetuses can\u0026rsquo;t hear vowel sounds well enough through their mother\u0026rsquo;s tissue to learn them precisely in-utero.\nHowever, babies who trained on the vowels they were tested on did better at distinguishing natural from unnatural vowels. Their brain activity spiked much higher and faster for natural vowels relative to backwards vowels compared to the active and passive controls.\nThe rest, or \u0026ldquo;consolidation\u0026rdquo; period, between the two tests seems to have been important. This is fancy science speak for \u0026ldquo;you need sleep to learn\u0026rdquo; — the babies pretty much all napped during that 2-hour \u0026ldquo;consolidation period.\u0026rdquo; Trained infants were better at distinguishing between forwards and backwards vowels after they had time to sleep on their training.\nWhen the researchers looked at the regions of the brain that were most active in the babies as they distinguished vowel sounds, they saw that many of the same regions important for adult language processing seem to be active in newborns too.\nFinally, and in my opinion most interestingly, there was no sign that the babies got better at recognizing the unnatural backwards vowels even after training — it seems that, at least to some degree, we come into the world hard-wired for language.\nLanguage learning — whether you enjoy it or not — seems to be one of the very first thing your brain started doing as soon as you were born (and maybe earlier). And you\u0026rsquo;re still processing language using the same old neural circuits that kicked in when you were born. Besides coordinating your basic bodily functions, you\u0026rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find something else that your brain has had more time to practice.\n","date":"June 30, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/sciene-of-language-newborns-start-recognizing-speech-within-hours-of-birth-in-way-similar-to-adults/","tags":["research","science of language learning","neuroscience"],"title":"Science of Language: Newborns learn speech sounds using same brain regions as adults"},{"categories":["Language Learning","Real Language Stories"],"contents":" Note from Elise\nThis post is the first in the “Real Language Stories\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; series, in which real language learners share their journeys with their first foreign languages in their own words.\nHave a story you’d like to share? Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com to learn more.\nMy language learning journey started in an American high school. I studied French for four years. I was a serious student. I had always felt drawn to the language by way of my family history — my ancestors on my mother’s side were French, and many generations of her family lived in French-speaking Quebec, Canada. Learning French was, to me, a way to connect to that heritage.\nUnfortunately, my French classes didn’t do much in the way of fostering that connection. They did a lot more to foster frustration.\nI always did my homework and I scored well on exams. I could read at a basic level and, given enough time and a dictionary, I could write some simple sentences. But after four years, I could neither speak French nor understand spoken French.\nMy teachers were totally focused on grammar and particularly on conjugation. My classmates and I churned through what seemed like endless conjugation drills and quizzes. The best part of the class was a “language lab” once a week in which we listened to the most ridiculous and boring dialogues ever written, all in excruciatingly slow French. Even though I was a diligent student, I could not pay attention to those insipid dialogues. And even if I had, I still wouldn’t have understood much unless I could have found a French person willing to pause for two seconds between each word.\nI found the whole experience very frustrating, but I decided that, some day, I would really learn French and achieve my goal of connecting to that piece of my family history.\nA second start “Some day” arrived 44 years later. I had retired from my career as a software engineer and wanted a new intellectual challenge. Learning French was the perfect project and would fulfill my lifetime objective of learning French.\nWhen I shared my new goal with my wife, a retired French teacher, she said that while she would offer encouragement and answer questions, she was not going to teach me French under any circumstances. I was fine with that (not that I had a choice) and started with Duolingo. I started to use Duolingo and every other free app I could find, but only for about ten minutes a day. After a year, I had learned some basic vocabulary but otherwise hadn’t made any progress and I decided to get serious.\nI bought two textbooks with workbooks and audio CDs for A1 and A2 level French from the Saison series of Didier. I actually date the beginning of my time learning French from that point. I don’t count that first year because I learned so little (and spent so little time learning).\nMy French textbooks. I learned a lot more from these than I ever did from language apps, but the real breakthrough came after I discovered “comprehensible input” and started listening to many hours of French a day.\nI read the textbooks, did all the exercises, and listened to the CDs. After working my way through those two books, I bought the next in the series, which was at B1 level, and continued to plug away at French.\nThis took about five months, and during that time, I never attempted to speak French. I started to get bored.\nThese textbooks were far better than my high school texts, and the audio was definitely more interesting (it would be impossible for it to be less interesting), but the primary focus was still on grammar. I was “learning” French, but I was losing motivation. I felt as if it would take me forever to become fluent, especially since I hadn’t tried to speak at all.\nSo I decided to sign up for a two week intensive course at a language school in Montpelier, France. The school recommended a minimum of one month, but I couldn’t afford that. Two weeks would have to do. I had three months to prepare for the course — three months before leaving for France.\nI also asked my wife if she were willing to speak French with me. She agreed and we started having conversations in French a few times a week, and four years later we’re still having those conversations. I would never have gotten to my current level without those talks, and without her patiently answering my questions.\nMe at the entrance to the Accent Français language school in Montpelier, where I took an intensive French course for two weeks that brought me from a B1 level to B2.\nMoving past textbooks I also decided to explore YouTube for new material. In hindsight, that was a blindingly obvious thing to do, but I had been stuck in the view that you learned a language with textbooks. I discovered Johan’s channel Français Authentique and started watching all his videos. Johan is a disciple of Stephen Krashen and believes that the primary way to learn a language is through comprehensible input — material in your target language that you can almost perfectly understand.\nAfter learning about comprehensible input, my learning strategy changed dramatically. I started watching interviews with Krashen and reading his studies on language acquisition. I completely abandoned my textbooks and grammar study and spent at least two hours a day watching YouTube videos in French and listening to podcasts in French. I also started reading Le Petit Prince in French, because that’s the book everyone recommends for beginners (by the way, it’s not a good book for beginners).\nI spent three months listening to a lot of French, reading a lot of French, and having a lot of regular conversations in French with my wife. I started to listen to podcasts while doing all my chores. My listening comprehension and reading improved dramatically. On the other hand, my speaking progressed very slowly. I could have a conversation but only with lots of pauses. My speaking wasn’t fluid at all and I made lots of mistakes.\nOnce I finally arrived at the language school in Montpelier, I took a placement test that consisted of a grammar test, a reading test, and a conversation with a teacher. I was flabbergasted to be placed in a B1.8 class (out of B1.1 - 10).\nAt the school, we had three 50-minute classes per day, plus an hour of homework (always writing an essay). During class we spoke a lot, usually in small groups or pairs. We also watched videos and took quizzes on the content. In addition, my wife and I stayed with a “welcome family” — in our case, an elderly divorced woman. She prepared dinner for us every evening and we always had a 60–90-minute conversation with her during dinner.\nVegetable shopping at a market in Montpelier, France that I visited during my two-week intensive language course. Communicating with the vendors was a learning experience.\nB2 and beyond After two weeks, I took tests in reading, listening, writing, and speaking. I was evaluated at B2 overall, with very high marks on listening and reading. All that time spent listening and reading definitely paid off.\nOne of my teachers said that she had never seen anyone\u0026rsquo;s speaking improve so dramatically in such a short amount of time. According to her, my speaking level had gone from B1 to low B2 in two weeks.\nObviously, the conversations with my wife and the intensive speaking practice during the two week course were critical, and my experience was certainly not a perfect experiment because I was not a true beginner. I had four years of high school French 45 years (!) earlier. But I believe that my relatively rapid success (A1 to B2 in 9 months) shows that an input-heavy method really works. Once I started spending 75% of my time listening and reading, my French ability started to improve exponentially\nBut what about getting beyond B2?\nI still rely heavily on input, but I make a point of practicing speaking regularly, too. I found online language partners with whom I have conversations for 30 minutes in French and 30 minutes in English every week, usually three conversations a week. I continue to read and spend even more time listening to podcasts. I started watching French shows on Netflix and on YouTube. Once again, my wife helps enormously because I found shows that she also likes so we watch an hour of French content most evenings. She’s developed a strong attachment to a few French TV shows. I basically immerse myself in French — at least as much as one can “immerse” while living in the USA.\nFour years after that language school experience, I believe I am at a C1 level overall. So, 9 months to B2, then another 4 years to C1. I guess I’m a slow learner, but I still spend 75% of my time on input. A month ago I started my next adventure, learning Italian.\nDavid Guy grew up in Massachusetts, USA.

The red-clad crowd numbered around 10,000 — an order of magnitude more than the number that had gathered in Belfast to protest Russia\u0026rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine just a few months prior. But war wasn\u0026rsquo;t on their minds — nor was police violence, climate change, energy prices, inflation, or any of the other headline-grabbing issues that have recently sparked large protests in other major cities.\nThe Belfast protesters filled the streets over something else entirely: language.\nOn Tuesday, May 24, the UK put forward a new bill that would finally make good on the country\u0026rsquo;s promise to grant the Irish language official status. The new bill, which has not passed yet, would come after years of delayed promises and much protest in Northern Ireland, where 2011 census counts (the most recent) report that about 3.7% of the population speak Irish fluently.\nOn the same day the UK\u0026rsquo;s new bill was proposed, another language law made headlines across the Atlantic. Quebec passed the controversial Bill 96, which legal limits on the use of languages other than French in much of public life.\nWhile the proposed UK bill seems to have been mostly positively received, Bill 96 met sharp criticism even before it passed. Large protests against it took place in Montreal in anticipation of the bill\u0026rsquo;s adoption, and Canada\u0026rsquo;s federal government seems to be contemplating a legal challenge to Quebec\u0026rsquo;s new French law already. More protests are planned. Indigenous activists have criticized the bill as potentially harmful to their communities, and to indigenous languages.\nThe coincidence of these two new language laws invites comparison, and at first glance they\u0026rsquo;re quite similar. Both bills intend to protect regional languages within larger Anglophone countries against English, a language with a lot of power and draw. But there are significant differences between the UK\u0026rsquo;s proposed Irish law and Quebec\u0026rsquo;s Bill 96, too — differences that raise questions about the purpose of legislating language at all.\nMaking Irish official If passed, the UK\u0026rsquo;s new Irish language law will recognize Irish as an official language in Northern Ireland, where it was the majority language centuries ago. As of 2011, about 3.7% of people in Northern Ireland could speak, read, and write in Irish.\nThe Irish language already enjoys some special privileges under the 1992 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The new law will go further, explicitly allowing the use of Irish in courts, establishing a new Office of Identity and Cultural Expression to promote cultural pluralism in Northern Ireland, and creating new posts for commissioners dedicated to the Irish and Ulster Scots languages.\nThe new law grew out of a messy political situation. It was promised a few years ago as part of a political deal to re-establish the executive government of Northern Ireland after a scandal resulted in its collapse in 2017. The bill was a sticking point in negotiations to re-establish the government, which took years to hash out. Protests from activist groups gained steam recently after it looked like the bill would be delayed again. It\u0026rsquo;s a long story, but you can read about it here, here, and of course, on Wikipedia.\nThis possible new Irish-language law comes after the UK established official recognition in 2011 for Welsh, another minority Celtic tongue. It also establishes protections for Ulster-Scots, another minority language in Northern Ireland, though the head of the Ulster Scots Language Society seemed skeptical of the bill in her remarks to the BBC.\nQuebec\u0026rsquo;s controversial French law, Bill 96 Quebec\u0026rsquo;s Bill 96, which passed on May 24, concerns the French language.\nFrench is the only official language in Quebec, so the new law does not establish new protections or rights for French speakers. Rather, it limits the use of other languages in public life, including in education, business, courts and government services (which, in Canada, includes medical care).\nA few major points:\nThe bill caps enrollment in English-language colleges and requires that students without special language exemptions — typically granted when at least one parent was educated in English — attend at least three of their major subject courses in French. To graduate, students without language exemptions in English-language programs will need to pass a French exam.\nNew immigrants will be required to receive all government services in French within 6 months of arrival, even if the civil servants working with them can speak their languages.\nBusinesses with more than 25 employees will need to prove that they have a plan in place to ensure that French is used as their common workplace language (businesses with more than 50 employees already have this requirement). Requiring employees to have language skills in any language other than French is not permitted unless the employer can demonstrate that the other language is necessary for the work.\nThe point of the law is to prevent the French language from declining in Quebec, which already has rules in place promoting French over other languages, especially in education and business. In recent years, Quebec has made news for its at times bizarre attempts to prevent itself from becoming \u0026ldquo;another Louisiana.\u0026rdquo; The government pondered banning the popular bilingual greeting \u0026ldquo;bonjour/hi\u0026rdquo; a few years ago (it didn\u0026rsquo;t).\nA majority — about 62% — of Quebecers support the bill, according to an online poll of 1,080 people. Opinion on the bill is sharply divided along language lines: 95% of anglophones were strongly or somewhat against the bill, whereas 77% of francophones strongly or somewhat support it.\nIs French doing OK in Quebec? Unlike Irish, French is not a minority language in Quebec, nor is it on its way to becoming one. One arguably sensationalized article claiming a \u0026ldquo;breaking point\u0026rdquo; in French language decline in Quebec cited studies predicting that the proportion of francophones in Quebec will sink from 79% in 2011 to some 71% by 2036.\nThis 8 percentage-point decline however, will not be matched by proportional gains in the English speaking population. The same study projects the anglophone population growing from about 11% in 2011 to 13% in 2036. Immigrants whose native language is neither French nor English make up the difference. Another study projecting futher,\nEven though the population will remain majority Francophone (which other studies also predict), English is becoming more important in workplaces in Quebec. About 40% of business in Quebec require or want their employees to speak English. In Montreal, the rate is even higher — about two-thirds of employers want their employees to speak English.\nHowever, some experts think that the \u0026ldquo;English-at-work\u0026rdquo; statistic may be misleading, giving the false impression that French is dying out. Employees don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be taking English home with them. Even in English-happy Montreal, only 7% of the population speaks only English. 36% speak only French, and most — 55% — speak both French and English.\nFor context, about 20% of Americans speak a language other than English at home according to census data from 2009-2013 (the only years I could find in the Census Bureau\u0026rsquo;s language section). In some states, the proportion is much higher. As of 2016, about 44.6% of Californians did not speak English at home.\nOfficial languages should be promises, not prohibitions At their best, official languages are promises, not prohibitions.\nDesignating an official language does not — unless you write the laws that way — rule out the use of other languages when it makes sense. It simply guarantees that, when you speak that language, the state will hear you.\nEnglish is rather famously not the official language of the United States, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have one. But it is in many states. The official language of California, for instance, is English. But visit California and you\u0026rsquo;ll see plenty of Spanish around, including in government communications. That\u0026rsquo;s because the official language being English does not rule out California using Spanish when it makes sense. This allows the state to respond more dynamically to the needs of its community by providing services in Spanish in certain areas.\nOf course, not every language can be made official everywhere. Doing so would just be governments making promises they couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep. But making specific minority languages official in places with substantial speaker communities can protect those communities and preserve their connections to their language and cultural heritage.\nPreserving those connections can have enormous consequences for well-being. Suicide rates among Indigenous youth in British Columbia are substantially lower in communities where at least half of the population speaks their ancestral language. It is not a coincidence that indigenous communities around the world are choosing to dedicate serious time, effort, and resources into reinvigorating and in some cases resurrecting their languages rather than simply adopting majority languages such as Spanish or English — even though doing so would come with obvious economic and social advantages.\nMaking minority languages official can protect the communities that use them. This is along the lines of what the UK\u0026rsquo;s Irish law seems aimed to do. It extends the guarantee of government services in Irish to its Irish-speaking citizens, giving them the right to speak to the state — and be spoken to — in their own language.\nWhat do language laws really protect? Quebec\u0026rsquo;s Bill 96 is a different kind of language law. French is already the sole official language in Quebec. Bill 96 does not extend language rights, but rather limits the use of non-official languages to promote the official language, French.\nQuebec has long had laws limiting English (and other languages) — limits on which students can attend school in English, for instance. The new law goes a few steps further, tightening restrictions the use of all languages other than French in public life and preventing state employees from providing services in other languages in most cases.\nThis is potentially problematic, not least because limiting the state\u0026rsquo;s ability to use non-official languages makes government more rigid and unable to serve the needs of people who live there.\nFor instance, it is unclear whether English will be permitted for use in healthcare contexts under the new law. Lawmakers say it will, but some healthcare providers say it is a gray area. Rules already in place before Bill 96 mean that, without a language exception, Ukrainian children arriving in Quebec as refugees from the war in their home country must attend school in French) – even if they have already studied English as a second language.\nExplicitly prohibiting use of non-official languages by state officials also threatens the fragile rights of minorities and minority languages, including indigenous groups. Indigenous activists concerned that the bill will threaten their own languages and communities are already challenging the bill.\nIn many ways, Bill 96 appears more concerned with promoting French than promoting human well-being. Preserving linguistic diversity is important, and sometimes laws can be the right tool for the job. But language laws promoting linguistic diversity should not come at the expense of… well… linguistic diversity.\nThe proportion of French native speakers in Quebec is projected to decline a few percent over the next decade, and English is widely used in offices. However, this does not seem to be because French speakers are swapping English for their native tongue. Rather, the proportion of Quebecers speaking a language other than French or English is increasing with immigration. Linguistic diversity in Quebec is increasing, not decreasing.\nNor do high workplace English use rates reflect what happens off the clock. Far more Quebecers speak both French and English than speak English alone, and far more Quebecers speak just French than just English. A mostly bilingual population — something rather unique in North America — and could easily be seen as a competitive advantage, not a problem.\nAnd demand for English at the workplace is not reflected in better career prospects for English speakers: French speakers in Quebec have a lower unemployment rate and higher earnings than English speakers, who make up Quebec\u0026rsquo;s most diverse language group. A quarter of English speaking Quebecers belong to \u0026ldquo;visible minorities,\u0026rdquo; most of whom are Black or South Asian.\nIt remains to be seen how the UK bill will play out. But even considering its politically fraught background, its purpose appears just: it guarantees the Irish-speaking minority in Northern Ireland the right to receive services in their language and makes it easier to preserve an important piece of the cultural heritage of the region.\nBut what is Bill 96 \u0026ldquo;protecting,\u0026rdquo; exactly? French speakers? The French language — the majority and sole official language in Quebec?\nWhen a language law seems more concerned with protecting a language than it is with protecting people, it\u0026rsquo;s time to start asking questions.\n","date":"May 30, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/who-needs-language-laws/","tags":["Politics","Minority languages","French"],"title":"Who needs language laws?"},{"categories":["German","Italian","Language diary","Language learning"],"contents":"Welcome back to my language diary.

Even if I don\u0026rsquo;t end up reaching my goal of B2 in Italian, I\u0026rsquo;ll still be so happy to have spent some time with this language.\nMy learning \u0026ldquo;strategy\u0026rdquo; right now, if you could call it a strategy, is to use Speakly every morning for about 10-20 minutes (~10 new words/phrases per day) and then do whatever I feel like for an hour or two throughout the day.\nLately, \u0026ldquo;whatever I feel like doing\u0026rdquo; has mostly been doing Speakly\u0026rsquo;s listening exercises, working through the amazing graded reader/textbook hybrid l\u0026rsquo;Italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura, and watching Learning Italian with Lucrezia and Easy Italian on YouTube. I also occasionally skim a grammar textbook and dip my toes into native content whenever I\u0026rsquo;m in the mood to hit my head repeatedly against a wall — and let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get that craving from time to time?\nI also meet with an iTalki tutor once a week and she assigns me homework, which is usually reading short chapters in an A2-level graded reader (Amici Nemici) or listening to/watching something in comprehensible Italian.\nMy favorite Italian beginner resources so far I\u0026rsquo;m at this delightful stage with Italian right now where everything is new and useful, and I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed exploring the numerous (and often free) beginner resources out there for this language. Here are my favorites right now:\nl\u0026rsquo;Italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura — the bizarre graded reader/textbook hybrid I never knew I needed. It\u0026rsquo;s basically a novel that starts out in sub-A1 super repetitive Italian and brings you up beyond B2, all without any English whatsoever. I read a chapter to myself out loud about every 2 days. Speakly. After futzing around with Anki forever I finally switched to Speakly and love it. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Duolingo sans the cutsey characters and memeworthy useless sentences with a very thoughtful vocabulary set. I learn at least 10 \u0026ldquo;words\u0026rdquo; (unclear what Speakly counts as a word) a day and reached the 500 \u0026ldquo;words\u0026rdquo; mark today. Speakly also offers courses in Russian, German, Spanish, French, Finnish, and Estonian for English speakers. Easy Italian. I love that this YouTube channel is almost entirely in Italian — there\u0026rsquo;s nothing I hate more than comprehensible input resources that switch to English all the time. They have a Super Easy Italian playlist that I\u0026rsquo;ve been using a lot. Simple Italian Podcast. Slow, comprehensible Italian in podcast form? Interesting topics that aren\u0026rsquo;t just Italian culture? Yes please. I love to have some kind of comprehensible/slow audio running in the background when I\u0026rsquo;m doing chores or menial tasks, and this fills that niche in my Italian learning environment perfectly. The last 2 weeks of German was basically just bingeing the dub of Roman Empire and sitting around in Austria 🇦🇹 Last month\u0026rsquo;s major win — convincing my partner to watch Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Dark with me in German — has snowballed into an even bigger win. He\u0026rsquo;s now watching German dubs with me all the time.\nClemens hates dubs, which is maybe one of the reasons his English is so fluent. But I think he\u0026rsquo;s realized that it might, you know, help me to learn his language if he\u0026rsquo;s willing to suffer through German dub acting from time to time. So we\u0026rsquo;re almost exclusively watching TV in German now, which last week meant bingeing through the German dub of Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Roman Empire. Victory!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also been a lot easier to maintain German right now because we\u0026rsquo;re back in Austria for our wedding this week, so I\u0026rsquo;m using the language every day. Just kinda sitting around in the house and chit chatting with Clemens\u0026rsquo; mom while she cooks and listens to Austrian radio is a surprisingly effective learning strategy. My dialect is also getting a bit better being here.\nCrosstalk vs language exchange for beginners The biggest change to the way I\u0026rsquo;m learning Italian in the past two weeks was my decision to start meeting with an Italian exchange partner for crosstalk — I speak English to her and she responds in Italian for the entire exchange.\nCrosstalk is something I only recently discovered through the Dreaming Spanish YouTube channel (Spanish, I\u0026rsquo;m coming for you eventually I swear) and it isn\u0026rsquo;t something I ever did with German. But thinking about it, it seems like a logical extension of my learning style, which relies heavily on comprehensible input. And crosstalk is basically interactive comprehensible input — comprehensible+ input?\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely loving crosstalk so far and wish I had started it with German at the very beginning. I highly recommend checking out this video from Dreaming Spanish (it has English subtitles). It explains crosstalk and its advantages and goes into how it plays nice with comprehensible input. And this video is just one video in a great playlist — all with English subs — introducing comprehensible input and how it can be used to start learning a new language.\nAdvantages of crosstalk Crosstalk has all of the advantages of a traditional language exchange —increasing motivation, adding accountability to your learning, helping you make friends, etc. — with the exception of being an opportunity to practice speaking.\nBut in exchange for speaking practice, crosstalk provides three major advantages over traditional language exchange:\nYou really can start crosstalk from day 1 — people are good at miming and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to figure out what people mean than it is to say something in their language. I can barely conjugate essere (to be) in the present tense in Italian but I can crosstalk for an hour without issues. Crosstalk can provide twice as much native input in your target language as traditional language exchange — If you crosstalk for 60 minutes and speak half the time, you get 30 minutes of input from your partner and spend 60 continuous minutes interacting with your target language. In a traditional language exchange, you trade input for output and spend less continuous time interacting with the language. In 60 minutes, you\u0026rsquo;d interact with your target language for 30 minutes and in that time you\u0026rsquo;d speak for 15 minutes and get 15 minutes of native speech from your partner. Crosstalk won\u0026rsquo;t lithify your bad language habits — Crosstalk doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you the chance to practice wrong. Exchange partners model correct speech for you, but they are not trained teachers who know how to correct your mistakes. Staying silent with German and learning by listening for a while helped me develop a good accent and didn\u0026rsquo;t give me a chance to practice bad habits that might otherwise have followed me from A1 to B2. (Note: This is a controversial view in the language learning community, many claim that speaking from day 1 is the way to go. I think a silent or mostly-silent period is helpful.) Bonus advantage: crosstalk respects your language partner\u0026rsquo;s time when you\u0026rsquo;re a super-beginner who can\u0026rsquo;t say much more than \u0026ldquo;hi\u0026rdquo; Unpopular opinion: It\u0026rsquo;s annoying to try language exchange with people who can barely speak your language at all. Upper-intermediate is where it gets fun, you can make mistakes together and laugh. Talking to someone who struggles to say more than \u0026ldquo;Hi I\u0026rsquo;m NAME from PLACE\u0026rdquo; for an hour is exhausting and no fun.\nCrosstalk is less frustrating for your exchange partners when you\u0026rsquo;re not at a real speaking level yet. It allows you to talk about a wider variety of topics that\u0026rsquo;s more interesting to both you and your partner, and it lets you get to know each other faster and more personally.\nWhen to start crosstalk and how to find a crosstalk partner Crosstalk rocks — and unlike traditional exchange, I think beginners should start crosstalk as soon as they want to. Start on day 1 if you can. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly motivating to use your target language as a communication medium even before you can speak it.\nI think crosstalk could be especially helpful for people who struggle to focus on beginner resources or aren\u0026rsquo;t motivated by them. This is actually a point my Italian partner made during our last chat. She\u0026rsquo;s bored by textbooks and beginner resources like graded readers — and yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re mostly boring. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to be bored when you\u0026rsquo;re talking to a real, breathing person. And it\u0026rsquo;s rude to not pay attention to them. The social pressure to be nice helps you stay focused and keep trying to understand, even when it\u0026rsquo;s difficult.\nIf you want to find a crosstalk partner, I recommend either paying $6 for a month of MyLanguageExchange.com\u0026rsquo;s gold membership (which allows you to send messages rather than just receive them) and sending off a dozen or so messages telling folks you\u0026rsquo;re looking for crosstalk. People tend to be serious about learning languages on that site, and once you\u0026rsquo;ve found a partner you won\u0026rsquo;t need the gold membership anymore.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a free option and can\u0026rsquo;t find someone through your existing online network, both HelloTalk and Tandem are options to consider. I use HelloTalk to find partners, but be prepared to wade through a real swamp of unwanted flirty messages on either app. The only way I\u0026rsquo;ve had luck finding good partners is to directly message same-gender folks (or different-gender folks who clearly mention a partner in their bio) who list clear reasons why they\u0026rsquo;re learning your language in their profile.\nBeen using tandem again lately, but the whole experience is kinda throwing me off 🙃 I\u0026#39;m curious, what kind of problems do you have with language exchange apps? #langtwt\nmaybe it\u0026#39;s just me though 😅😂\n\u0026mdash; Language Learning Hub (@LangLearnHub) February 8, 2022 Wherever you find partners, them clearly tell them what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for at the start and don\u0026rsquo;t mess around with \u0026ldquo;hi, how are you?\u0026rdquo; crap for very long. A good partner will be responsive and work with you quickly to find a time to chat via Skype/Zoom/etc. There are enough folks online these days that there\u0026rsquo;s no need to keep waiting on someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t respecting your time.\nUp next: graded readers (probably) I hope you enjoyed this little update and my quick thoughts on crosstalk. Next time I\u0026rsquo;m planning to write a bit about how I\u0026rsquo;ve been using graded readers as a beginner in Italian and how I did (and, really, didn\u0026rsquo;t) use them for German in the past.\nUntil then, let me know in the comments what you think about crosstalk. Have you given it a try? Do you prefer traditional language exchange, even as a beginner? And do you like to find language exchange partners?\nCiao!\n","date":"February 9, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/language-diary-2-first-italian-exchange/","tags":["Language learning tips","Teach yourself a language","Beginner language learning"],"title":"Language Diary #2: Italian Crosstalk"},{"categories":["Italian","German","Language diary"],"contents":"I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she\u0026rsquo;s doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.\nAnyhow, you can expect to see a little update from me every week from here on. Each entry in my \u0026ldquo;language diary\u0026rdquo; here will lay out the languages I\u0026rsquo;m working on at the moment and the resources I\u0026rsquo;m using before briefly exploring a little question I had related to language learning in the previous week.\nLanguage Diary #1 — January 27, 2022\nActive languages: Italian (~A1-) and German (~B2+)\nLanguages on-hold: Spanish (~A1) and Danish (~A1-)\nItalian - beginner (maaaybe A1?)\nTotal time studied: ~3 months Current focus streak: ~1 month Learner resources: Speakly, Learn Italian with Lucrezia, Easy Italian, Modern Italian Grammar, iTalki tutor Native content: Storia di Roma (way too hard, just for background noise while running) German - advanced (B2+)\nTotal time studied: ~2.75 years Current focus streak: ~2.75 years Resources in use: Speakly, Slowly, my boyfriend, speaking partner Native content: MrWissen2Go, Kurzgesagt, Dark, ORF.at, Drachenfeuer by Wolfgang Hohlbein After a detour through Spanish, I\u0026rsquo;m back to Italian and loving it I started dabbling in Italian in early fall, but Spanish really captured my interest in November and December and I took a detour into Spanish for a while. These days my motivation has swung a full 180 back towards Italian and Italian has been my focus for the past month or so.\nOne key factor in motivating me to commit to Italian for now is my amazing tutor on iTalki. I used to think that lessons for true beginners were mostly a waste of time and money, but my first lesson with my Italian tutor really changed my mind. A skilled teacher can definitely make a difference at the beginning — though I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pay for casual conversation practice until I can, you know, kinda hold a casual conversation.\nWhat about Spanish? I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely be back to Spanish — I know I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to resist forever! I\u0026rsquo;ve been waffling between the two sister languages since November, but I\u0026rsquo;ve committed to Italian until the beginning of April for now. I\u0026rsquo;ll re-evaluate how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling about Spanish at that point.\nLong-term, my goal is to get Italian to around B1 (or wherever \u0026ldquo;conversational fluency\u0026rdquo; ends up being) and then focus on getting to that point with either Spanish or Danish depending on motivation.\nContinuing to plink along with German With German it\u0026rsquo;s been all B2-to-C1 plateau business as usual: chatting with a speaking partner at least once a week, using Speakly (10 words/day), writing to penpals, and consuming as much native content as I can. I\u0026rsquo;m very motivated for Italian at the moment, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that all the Italian input I\u0026rsquo;ve been consuming is carving out chunks of time and attention I\u0026rsquo;d usually siphon into German.\nA major victory in the last few weeks was finally convincing my (German-speaking) boyfriend to watch Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Dark with me in German, which over all 3 seasons was around 28 hours of input. Not bad. I\u0026rsquo;m also speaking more German with him at home lately, which has been a nice little shift.\nHow should you choose which of your target languages to focus on? Following my gut and deciding to focus on Italian even though I have some solid reasons for learning Spanish was tough. And making the switch got me thinking: since I\u0026rsquo;m learning multiple languages, how should I decide which ones to focus on at any given point? When is it okay to switch?\nThe short answer: It\u0026rsquo;s fine to switch to follow motivation. Life is not a contract signed in blood that a demon is going to show up to enforce every time you stray from your original plans.\nNormalize stopping to learn a language because of changing priorities and goals 🤗 dabbling is ok 🌼\n\u0026mdash; Lindie Botes ✦ Languages \u0026amp; Design (@lindiebee) October 5, 2020 Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a bit more to it than that. It\u0026rsquo;s true that hopping around too frequently can mean you end up dabbling in a lot of languages but never learning any of them to the standards you set for yourself (read that again!). As a solution to this problem, I\u0026rsquo;m trying out a strategy of making short-term commitments with end-dates. The idea is that this will allow me to make a satisfying chunk of progress while still leaving room to respond to my motivation and current situation.\nThink about what makes sense now I took Mandarin courses in middle school. Back then, I was enthralled by the language and couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine ever abandoning it. Fast-forward 10 years and I can think of 15 languages I\u0026rsquo;d rather learn before Mandarin.\nShould I force myself to learn it anyways? After all, I took 2 years of Mandarin when I was a preteen, and I promised myself I\u0026rsquo;d learn the language back then. It was a goal! I need to follow through!\n\u0026hellip; ridiculous, right?\nGoals change. Life changes. It\u0026rsquo;s great to have some vision for the future, but priorities shift and we need to be real about that.\nSpanish is appealing to me mostly for three reasons: language aesthetics, size of native speaker community, and the fact that I used to be okay at it in high school.\nOk, I\u0026rsquo;m also into Spanish because of the existence of Borges. 3.5 reasons.\nUntil recently, those 3.5 reasons kept me more motivated for Spanish than for Italian. But my situation has changed and now there are some reasons it makes sense for me to focus on Italian instead.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;m moving to Austria soon. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of Austro-Italo exchange since Austria borders Italy, and I can easily imagine spending time in Italy since it\u0026rsquo;ll be so close by. Second, my mom recently decided that she may want to retire in Italy. If she actually wants to do that, me learning Italian could make a huge difference when it comes to making that dream actually possible.\nI really value learning languages that I think I\u0026rsquo;ll actually use, so these two factors really pushed my motivation for Italian beyond my motivation for Spanish. Finding an incredible tutor, discovering that Italian just sounds awesome, and finding some really great beginners resources just threw a cherry on top.\nSwitching to Italian was a response to my current situation — including soft factors like motivation. And I think we should always choose languages to learn based on where we are now rather than where when we set goals in the past.\nTaking a break is fine. Your other target languages aren\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere\u0026hellip; unless they are. Keeping track of your \u0026ldquo;current situation\u0026rdquo; also includes making the best of time-limited special opportunities to learn one of your target languages like being in the country or taking a university course. Switching back to Spanish in the middle of an Italy trip might not be worth it.\nMake a short-term commitment and know when your next chance to switch is coming So, how to actually put that rambling thought into practice?\nCommitting to a subset of your target languages for a defined period — say a month or a quarter — might give you enough time to make a satisfying amount of progress without locking yourself into a language that isn\u0026rsquo;t sparking your interest for too long.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doing this with Italian now. I decided to stick with it until at least the beginning of April. That\u0026rsquo;s 3 months to focus on Italian, which I think should be enough to get to a point where I can understand a fair bit of what I hear in relatively straightforward authentic content — a nice point to reach even if I don\u0026rsquo;t go further. After those 3 months, I can decide if I want to go on with Italian for another chunk of time.\nWriting down the plan is helping me stick with it: I noted my intention to stick with Italian until at least the beginning of April in my digital goal-setting notebook (the Notion people finally got me). I also booked lessons with a tutor through the end of my Italian study period to keep me accountable.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all from me for this week. How do you handle dabbling and shifting motivations? Have you tried something like the short-term commitment suggestion I outline? Let me know what you think in the comments below.\nCiao!\n","date":"January 26, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/language-diary-1-somehow-we-re-back-to-italian/","tags":["Learn German","Learn Italian","Beginner language learning","Advanced language learning","Speakly"],"title":"Language Diary #1: Italian and making short-term language plans"},{"categories":["Language learning"],"contents":"I didn\u0026rsquo;t book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate level (about B1 for you CEFR people).\nI used to think that it\u0026rsquo;d be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner. For me, working with tutors was always about practicing speech — the only language skill I couldn\u0026rsquo;t learn alone. And why pay to talk to someone in your target language if you\u0026rsquo;re not ready to actually talk yet?\nThe few lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve taken in Spanish and Danish, two languages I\u0026rsquo;m not confident speaking in, didn\u0026rsquo;t convince me they were any more helpful than learning on my own. But recently, I started taking lessons in Italian, and working with my stellar Italian tutor completely changed my mind:\nIt can be worth it to work with a tutor as a total beginner — if you find the right teacher.\nWhy wait to hire a tutor? If you poll the language learning community, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear a range of opinions on whether tutors are worth it at the beginning (or at all). Waiting to start lessons worked well for me, and there certainly are good reasons to wait on hiring a language tutor until you reach an intermediate level.\nFirst, informal conversation lessons are generally cheaper than lessons for beginners. It takes more work and time to design lessons suitable for true beginners in a new language. Starting at an intermediate level means that you can opt for less expensive, informal conversation-based classes.\nLikewise, finding a tutor as a beginner can be more expensive. Community tutors — tutors who are not certified second-language teachers — on language tutoring marketplaces like iTalki often only offer informal conversation courses for intermediate and advanced students (some do teach beginners, though). Tutors who are confident guiding beginners from 0 to A1 are often certified teachers and therefore more expensive.\nMany of the things you need to learn as a beginner are easy to teach yourself for free, anyways. You can save yourself a nice chunk of cash by teaching yourself the basics.\nAnd finally — and perhaps most controversially — starting to speak too early might not be a great idea.\nMaybe don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;speak from day one\u0026rdquo; The jury is still out on whether \u0026ldquo;speaking from day one\u0026rdquo; — an approach popularized among others by Irish polyglot Benny Lewis of Fluent in 3 Months fame — is a good idea. I tend to think it isn\u0026rsquo;t, and that a silent period is important, for two reasons:\nOne, I don\u0026rsquo;t think struggling through formulaic beginner conversations is necessarily the best use of your time at the beginning. At the start, learning a few basic grammar rules and a core vocabulary of a few hundred words will rapidly increase your comprehension. If your foreign language has a script that you need to learn before you can read, learning that early is critical. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine how spending a few hours struggling through basic conversations would be more useful than giving yourself the core toolkit you need for comprehension.\nSecond — and this is definitely controversial — I think that speaking early can actually hinder learning, specifically by allowing you to practice incorrect speech and pronunciation. When you speak, you become your own \u0026ldquo;input.\u0026rdquo; And if you speak incorrectly, you are feeding yourself incorrect input. A silent period protects your brain from incorrect input for a while and gives you time to get a feel for your target language before you start using it and almost inevitably imposing your native language\u0026rsquo;s patterns and rules on it.\nHiring a tutor too early might give you the chance to speak and make mistakes that will stick with you as you improve and become hard to un-learn.\nHowever, I will caution here that a “silent period” in 2nd language acquisition by children isn’t even settled in the research yet, let alone in language-learning adults (Roberts 2014). Lots of polyglots swear by the speak-from-day-one approach, lots don\u0026rsquo;t. Do what feels right for you.\nHiring a tutor as a beginner can be very helpful — if you find the right tutor All that being said, I recently had an amazing experience with an Italian tutor that changed my mind about starting lessons as a beginner. I now believe that a tutor can be worth it from day one\u0026hellip; but only if they\u0026rsquo;re the right tutor.\nInformal conversation practice isn\u0026rsquo;t enough Many tutors on sites like iTalki offer mostly informal conversation practice. This is fantastic, since it makes speaking practice available at a more accessible price, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal for beginners who can\u0026rsquo;t hold conversations yet (see reasons above).\nThe right tutor for a beginner offers more than informal conversation practice. They need to — a true beginner can\u0026rsquo;t hold a conversation in their target language for 30 minutes or an hour.\nWhat a good tutor can do for beginners For me, a tutor is only \u0026ldquo;worth it\u0026rdquo; if working with them gives me something helpful I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get on my own.\nAt the intermediate level, that is speaking practice. At the beginner level, a skilled tutor can provide custom-tailored comprehensible input that teaches the things most relevant to you. They offer a window on the culture associated with your target language. And they can also do wonders for motivation.\nMy Italian tutor clearly plans our lessons around vocabulary that she anticipates will be relevant to me based on my iTalki profile and on what she learns about me during lessons. She modifies her speech so that I can understand it and so that it models the most common patterns I need to understand and communicate basic ideas in Italian. She recommends level-appropriate content in Italian for me to enjoy between lessons, and shares Italian culture with me as part of the lesson. She takes time to explain her approach and what she thinks I need to work on, which makes it easier for me to see the value her lessons bring me and understand if I\u0026rsquo;m making more progress with her than I would alone.\nHere are some things a great language tutor can do for a beginner:\nModify their speech so that it serves as a kind of dynamic, totally customized comprehensible input perfect for your level Model the correct use of forms you need to learn during conversation Recommend level-appropriate content for comprehensible input Customize the lesson material to expose you to the words most relevant to you and your life first Help you understand your level and your weak points Be a source of accountability that keeps you consistent Motivate you and inspire your interest in the language How to find the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; tutor as a beginner If you decide that you\u0026rsquo;d like to work with a tutor as a beginner, here are a few tips for finding one who will be a good fit.\nLook for someone who will show up with a lesson planned As a beginner, holding your own in a conversation lesson is a challenge\u0026hellip; a challenge I\u0026rsquo;m not totally convinced is worth at all. I know people do it, but I can think of many better things to do with 30 minutes to an hour as a beginner (learning core vocabulary, bare bones grammar, and scripts) than struggling through formulaic beginner dialogues. A tutor with a plan, however, can really make the best use of your time.\nKeep an eye out for tutors who use materials like images, slides, documents, videos, discussion prompts, etc. to structure lessons and who obviously have a plan for what to do with your time together. You should feel like you\u0026rsquo;re making more progress with your tutor than you would alone, and never have to struggle to come up with something to talk about or focus on during lessons yourself.\nMessage your tutor first to introduce yourself and ask if they take beginners This seems obvious, but it\u0026rsquo;s been helpful for me in the past. If a tutor\u0026rsquo;s profile or pricing intrigues you but you\u0026rsquo;re not sure if they take beginners, it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to ask. Providing a bit of information about yourself helps tutors customize lessons for you, too.\nTake advantage of trial lesson prices and shop around When you hire a tutor, you are not signing a blood contract binding you together forever. You\u0026rsquo;re free to move on and find someone else, or simply to shop around a bit before choosing one or two people to work with more consistently.\nTrial lessons are often cheaper than standard lessons and they\u0026rsquo;re a good chance to get to know tutors. Take advantage of them, and keep an eye out for signs that your teacher knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing with beginners:\nHas a lesson plan prepared before you show up Uses materials like slideshows and documents to aide learning Gives you individual feedback, esp. written down for later reference Customizes lessons so you learn the words you actually need first Simplifies their speech to provide you with comprehensible input Helps you find media in the language that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in Excites you about learning the language \u0026ldquo;Feels\u0026rdquo; correct — a good fit is sometimes a gut feeling Consider hiring a certified teacher There are certainly amazing community tutors out there who do great work with beginners. But if you want a safe bet that someone has experience working with beginners and can offer more than casual conversation, consider working with a certified teacher at the beginning. My current Italian tutor on iTalki is a certified teacher and she\u0026rsquo;s fantastic.\nIf certified teachers are too expensive for you long-term, booking lessons for your first month or two and then switching to a community tutor for conversation lessons could be a good compromise.\nThe bottom line: beginners should wait on casual conversation lessons, but can benefit from good tutors If you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner to your target language, I recommend that you wait on casual conversation lessons until you can actually hold a casual conversation — imperfectly, of course, but at least mostly without defaulting to your native language.\nBut finding the right tutor early on can be helpful. A good tutor can provide you with targeted comprehensible input — including their speech — that\u0026rsquo;s appropriate for your level. They can customize lessons to you, your needs, and your interests so that you learn what you specifically need first and skip things that you don\u0026rsquo;t need as often in the beginning. A good tutor can also add a source of accountability to your learning and inspire your love for the language — something that will help you learn more between your lessons no matter what you focus on together with your tutor.\nJust make sure you shop around to find the right tutor for you.\n","date":"January 22, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/is-it-worth-hiring-a-language-tutor-as-a-beginner/","tags":["Beginner language learning","Teach yourself a language","Language learning tips"],"title":"Is it worth hiring a language tutor as a beginner?"},{"categories":["Language Learning","Reviews"],"contents":"If you\u0026rsquo;re a language nerd like me, you probably waste hours reading books about languages that you could have spent actually learning one. And now you\u0026rsquo;re reading a review about a book about language learning instead of actually learning a language. So it goes.\nAnyhow, this is my first book review for the blog. Let me know what you like — and especially what you don\u0026rsquo;t like — so the next one can be better.\nNote: I was given a free ebook copy of The Language Secret by its author for review.\nThe Language Secret by John Stedman The subtitle of the book is \u0026ldquo;How to speak 10 languages badly\u0026quot;and if that\u0026rsquo;s your goal (and if those 10 languages are Romance and Germanic languages), you will find a lot to love in The Language Secret.\nHowever, the book misses the mark with its purported target audience—anglophone monoglots learning their first new language. The main takeaways get buried under jokes and pop-culture references and actionable \u0026ldquo;do this, not that, then do this\u0026rdquo; instructions are few and far between.\nThe Language Secret by John Stedman\nRating: ★★★★☆\nPrice: $9.99 (Kindle), $19.99 (Paperback), $29.99 (Hardcover) [Amazon]\nTLDR: Outstanding for #langtwt types trying to learn 15 languages, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give it to my monolingual mom who just wants to learn Italian\nThe good:\nThoroughly anti-perfectionist Lots of \u0026ldquo;lightbulb\u0026rdquo; moments for experienced learners Sections on the Romance and Germanic languages useful for anglophones who want to learn multiple languages at once The bad:\nOften lacks of clear, actionable instructions Takeaways get buried under references and quips Recommended vocabulary learning technique requires a partner The ugly:\nRambling introductions drove me insane. But that\u0026rsquo;s just me. What is \u0026ldquo;The Language Secret\u0026rdquo; anyways? The eponymous \u0026ldquo;Language Secret\u0026rdquo; of The Language Secret is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.\nAs language secrets go, I think this is a great one — an anti-perfectionism mantra I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep in my subconscious back-pocket for every time I encounter another person who keeps perfectly calligraphed bullet journals and actually uses Toggl.\nThe eponymous \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; of The Language Secret is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.\nLearning to be okay with being bad at stuff is a skill, and an important one for language learners. The fact is, most adult learners will never achieve native-like fluency (Lightbown 2000). And if it\u0026rsquo;s unusual — read: vanishingly rare — for adult language learners to achieve native-like fluency in a new language, there is no chance that you won\u0026rsquo;t suck at the beginning.\nShould that hold you back? Absolutely not. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I think Stedman\u0026rsquo;s anti-perfectionist \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; is some of the best language learning advice you could ask for.\nShould \u0026ldquo;speaking badly\u0026rdquo; really involve speaking? In defense of a silent period With its call to \u0026ldquo;speak badly\u0026rdquo; and specific advice aimed at starting to speak as quickly as possible — including knowingly ignoring proper grammar and using easier-to-learn, but incorrect work-arounds instead — The Language Secret falls firmly into the speak-from-day-one á la Benny Lewis camp.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that very early speaking is helpful—or even that it isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German badly, at least not in the way Stedman suggests, in a sort of \u0026ldquo;me, Tarzan\u0026rdquo; way. After about a year of soaking in comprehensible input, I started speaking at about a B1 level. Because of this, I never had the chance to develop bad habits at A1 that could follow me to B1.\nStill, the existence of a true \u0026ldquo;silent period\u0026rdquo; in 2nd language acquisition by children isn\u0026rsquo;t even settled in the research yet, let alone in language-learning adults (Roberts 2014). And at the end of the day, Stedman is the polyglot, not I. Go forth and speak badly if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want to do.\nAnd really, if you really need to be able to achieve perfect mastery over something to find it fulfilling, language learning is not for you. Find a hobby you can master, like solving Rubik\u0026rsquo;s cubes.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah-hah\u0026rdquo; moments for experienced learners Beyond its refreshing anti-perfectionism, Stedman\u0026rsquo;s book shines as a soft introduction to a few important ideas from linguistics that can be illuminating for language learners. If you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced learner who hasn\u0026rsquo;t already encountered these ideas, The Language Secret will set off lightbulbs left and right for you.\nThis is especially true if you\u0026rsquo;re studying or have ever studied a Germanic or Romance language. The two chapters on these language families do a good job of providing a \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; for many of the most important patterns and quirks of these popular languages.\nBut even if you\u0026rsquo;re studying Russian or Thai, the sections on grammar, idiom, register, and language families in general will all offer helpful insights. Anglophones, in particular, will benefit from the chapter on grammar which points out many of the patterns in English that tend to break down in other languages.\nIf you like learning a little bit of lots of languages, this book is for you I see a lot of people interested in many, many languages in the language learning corners of the internet. Look at people\u0026rsquo;s Twitter bios and you\u0026rsquo;ll see 13 different flags indicating their target languages.\nIf that sounds like you, The Language Secret can probably help you gain a rough understanding of many languages that you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for. The chapters on language families are intended to show how you can acquire basic vocabulary and grammar in many sister languages at once.\nNot the best book for first-time learners While I think experienced (and perhaps very motivated) learners can get a lot out of The Language Secret, I would not recommend this book to beginners.\nThe alternate title of the book is \u0026ldquo;How to speak 10 languages badly.\u0026rdquo; If that\u0026rsquo;s what you want, read the book. If you\u0026rsquo;re a monoglot just trying to learn Spanish, I suspect that you might leave Stedman\u0026rsquo;s tome a bit more confused than you came into it.\nThe important points get buried under excessive quips and references Unfortunately, The Language Secret buries most of its helpful points under a heap of unnecessary verbiage and indulgent references to pop-culture and history. And instead of providing clear instructions or highlighting the main points succinctly, it waxes sarcastic to indulge in line upon line of what I can only describe as very British humor. To get a sense of what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, look at the chapter titles in the next section.\nThis, in my view, makes the book almost unusable for beginners.\nIf you already have an idea of how to learn a language, the quips and random references could be fun icing on information you can take and incorporate into your existing learning practices. But for total newbies, the book does not offer clear enough directions. Loads of information is provided, but the \u0026ldquo;so what\u0026rdquo; is often missing.\nEach chapter begins with a few (ebook) pages devoted to a story that is in most cases only tangentially related to the topics at hand. References to that story will then show up over, and over, and over again throughout the chapter — alongside new references to other things that you may or may not have ever heard of before or care about.\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s my journalism experience (\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t bury the lede!\u0026rdquo;), but I found the references and extremely quippy tone excessive. And irritating. It especially bothered me that reference-laden quips took the place of bullet-points with the main takeaways at the end of each chapter.\nSuggested learning methods can be a tad out of touch My final bone to pick with The Language Secret is that the few specific methods it does suggest are often a bit out of touch.\nThe book doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to recognize that digital tools other than Google Translate and Duolingo exist. The section on spaced repetition doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention Anki, Memrise, or any of the other popular spaced repetition programs used widely in the language community.\nInstead of introducing Anki, The Language Secret suggests that you make paper flashcards and have a friend (in practice, I assume, romantic partner) drill you on them daily. The method outlined wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible to do using the cards on your own.\nFor pronunciation, the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t suggest shadowing or comprehensible input or even much listening — it suggests using the IPA. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, but I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the book specifying how exactly one should use the IPA to learn pronunciation.\nChapter breakdown The Language Secret is divided into an introduction, conclusion, and 10 chapters. Below are quick breakdowns of each of the 10 chapters. As you can see, the book covers a lot of ground!\nA quick note: I\u0026rsquo;ve introduced each chapter under my own \u0026ldquo;translated\u0026rdquo; titles. The real titles (provided below each \u0026ldquo;translation\u0026rdquo;) each consist of title, a subtitle, and a sub-subtitle and were a bit too long to look nice on the blog, so I summarized.\nChapter 1: The 4 Core Language Skills — Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing Original Title: \u0026ldquo;The Birmingham Screwdriver: In Which We Find Out How to Get Started and Use the Right Tools for the Job: What is Involved in Learning a Language and How Long It Takes\u0026rdquo;\nThe 4 core language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing Each skill needs to be learned using a different method (contrast with the Input Hypothesis, which holds that all skills are learned by receiving comprehensible input alone) The \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; — don\u0026rsquo;t be a perfectionist! Estimates that it would take ~45 hours over 6 months to learn to speak (but not write, read, or understand) a new language Chapter 2: How to Learn Vocabulary Original Title: \u0026ldquo;Caught in the Web of Words: In Which We Learn from a Scot Who Loved English: Active and Passive Vocabulary\u0026rdquo;\nGuidance on learning enough vocabulary to speak Techniques: mind maps, learning word formation patterns, using frequency lists, a partner flashcard technique Introduces the basic grammatical categories of words Highlights words in English that often don\u0026rsquo;t work the same in other language Chapter 3: Why we Need to Learn Grammar Original Title: \u0026ldquo;NABULIONE: In Which We Survey the Field of Battle as We Prepare to Vanquish a Foe: Morphology and Syntax.

For all of my frustration with this book\u0026rsquo;s tone and my recommendation that first-time learners skip it, The Language Secret is still a book I plan on recommending to a lot of people.\nUnlike many of the polyglot books I\u0026rsquo;ve come across, it\u0026rsquo;s honest and doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to convince you that if you just buy or do one thing, you\u0026rsquo;ll suddenly be fluent in a new language. It\u0026rsquo;s up-front about the work it takes to learn a language and honest about the factors beyond your control that can make it easier or harder. And it\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating look at the \u0026ldquo;everyday multilingualism\u0026rdquo; that exists in much of the world.\nInstead of focusing on the practical specifics of language learning, The Language Secret zooms out to offer an overview of many of the important concepts underpinning language and language learning, especially language families. Pick it up if you want to learn multiple languages and can handle a bit of rambling. Pass if you\u0026rsquo;re a newbie\u0026hellip; but consider coming back to it later, when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\nAnd do remember the \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; — to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly!\n","date":"December 20, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/book-review-the-language-secret/","tags":["Language learning books","Language resources","Book Reviews","Teach yourself a language"],"title":"Book Review: The Language Secret by John Stedman"},{"categories":["German","Language learning"],"contents":"Last week on Monday I officially went from monoglot to\u0026hellip; duo-glot? Bilingual sounds wrong. I didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up speaking two languages.\nAnyways, as a newly minted official Goethe Institute certified B2 German speaker, I wanted to stop and share how I prepped for the test—and really, how I didn\u0026rsquo;t prep for the test.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of advice out there for test-takers that I fundamentally disagree with. As always, it seems the consensus is that you need to execute some kind of hardcore bootcamp to do well on the B2 Goethe exam.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s really just a big load of crap, because I barely \u0026ldquo;studied\u0026rdquo; and still earned a nearly perfect score.\nCramming isn\u0026rsquo;t the way. Period. If you\u0026rsquo;re actually a B2 German speaker, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to cram.

If you make a purchase via an affiliate link, I receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.\nI self-studied mostly using comprehensible input for 2 years 99.9999% of all of the work that goes into your exam grade should come before you even sign up for the exam. No amount of cramming can make you B2 in a month. For me, it took 2 years of self-study to reach B2. And it\u0026rsquo;s those 2 years—not the 2 weeks of prep I did for the exam—that earned me great scores.\nNetflix, Spotify, and Duolingo will get you pretty far I overwhelmingly relied on comprehensible input to learn German. This sounds fancy, but in practice it meant watching loads of TV and listening to an unholy number of podcasts. Shout out to my mom for letting me leech off of her Netflix account all these years. You rock, Teri.\nComprehensible input is anything that you can understand in your target language. If n is your level, the best comprehensible input is n+1.\nNow, I jumped into German watching a lot of n+1000 content (looking at you, Dark on Netflix). But even if you\u0026rsquo;re stupid like me and refuse to use beginner resources you can still brute-force immersion yourself to fluency.\nNetflix isn\u0026rsquo;t your only option for comprehensible input, though. These days there are plenty of dedicated resources out there that are specially designed for language learners. Steve Kaufmann\u0026rsquo;s app Lingq is all about comprehensible input and Lingopie is basically Netflix for language learners.\nBut I was stubborn and got by with Netflix just fine.\nI can now officially confirm that 2 years of mostly just watching TV can get you to B2 German 🥳\n\u0026mdash; Elise Cutts (@elisecutts) December 13, 2021 For the first year, I relied exclusively on Duolingo (to learn basic vocabulary) and comprehensible input (Netflix, YouTube, and podcasts on Spotify) to learn German.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner and you want to get started learning with comprehensible input but don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, I wrote up a little resource with 11 tips to help beginners start learning with comprehensible input.

In practice, this meant chatting with my wonder iTalki tutor about once every two weeks and writing to penpals.\nMore recently, I found speaking partners to chat with occasionally via text and Skype. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Slowly to find and write to penpals and HelloTalk and MyLanguageExchange.com to find speaking partners.\nI tested at my real level, not my reach level Take the exam at your real level, not your reach level. If you\u0026rsquo;re testing at the right level, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to prep much.\nI leafed through a C1 practice test, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that I could have passed C1—with some serious prep. But why force it? I\u0026rsquo;m not a C1 speaker yet, even if I could fake it for an exam. I\u0026rsquo;ll pass C1 when I\u0026rsquo;m at C1.\nAnd if aren\u0026rsquo;t a B2 speaker yet but need the B2 certificate for something—like studying at a German university—maybe ask yourself if you\u0026rsquo;re really ready for whatever you need that certificate for. There\u0026rsquo;s no shame in waiting until you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go for B2.\nI DIDN\u0026rsquo;T cram Seriously, chill out. You do not need some kind of crazy 2-month study plan to prep for this test.\nI got a perfect score in speaking and writing, a 97% in reading, and a 93% in listening after a few weeks of relaxed exam prep. And I mean relaxed. I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 8 hours prepping over 2 weeks.\nOne of the girls taking the test with me told me a bit about the pre-exam study routines of YouTubers she followed and I just sat there blinking, nonplussed. People seriously do a practice exam a day for a month? Drill conjugations and vocabulary every day for two months? If that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;ll take to pass, why are you even taking the exam?\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fake it, make it. Take the exam you\u0026rsquo;re ready for and you won\u0026rsquo;t need to cram. Cramming doesn\u0026rsquo;t teach you anything long-term, it just inflates your level short-term.\nI spent a few weeks learning how to take the test Those 8 hours of prep were not devoted to learning new vocabulary or drilling grammar. I used them to learn how to take the test. The B2 Goethe exam is in B2 German, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test you on B2 German. It tests how well you can take the Goethe B2 German exam. So don\u0026rsquo;t prep your German, prep your test-taking.\nLike other standardized tests (e.g., the SAT, ACT, and GRE), the Goethe exam is much easier when you know what you\u0026rsquo;re walking into. Your ability to do well on tests like these often have a lot less to do with your mastery of the subject material than with your mastery of the test-taking format.\nEspecially for the speaking and writing sections, knowing what the graders will evaluate you on is critical. You could speak perfectly fluently and flunk just because your speech didn\u0026rsquo;t include a clear \u0026ldquo;beginning, middle, and end\u0026rdquo; as required.\nThe B2 Goethe exam is in B2 German, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test you on B2 German. It tests how well you can take the test. So don\u0026rsquo;t prep your German, prep your test-taking.\nThe good news is, you don\u0026rsquo;t need much time to learn the tasks the test will ask you to complete. A week or two is more than enough.\nI practiced the reading module once I know that I know how to read in German, so I only practiced the reading module one time. The point wasn\u0026rsquo;t to practice reading, the point was to get familiar with the kinds of questions the test asks. Basically: waste time reading the reading module instructions before the exam, not during the exam.\nIf you can read the news in German (which you should be able to do if you\u0026rsquo;re B2), one practice test to get familiar with exam format is more than enough prep for the reading module.\nI practiced the writing module a few times You\u0026rsquo;ll need to write two ~250 word writing samples for the Goethe B2 exam: an informal \u0026ldquo;forum post\u0026rdquo; and a formal email. For both tasks, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to structure formal arguments á la high school 5-paragraph essay.\nHigh school essay transitions: the only phrases worth memorizing\nI\u0026rsquo;m against memorization. But you can easily be B2 and not know the stilted transition phrases that exam graders like to see in writing samples and speeches (gotta have that sweet, sweet \u0026ldquo;structure\u0026rdquo;). Having a few of these in your back pocket before the test will take off a bit of stress:\nMeiner Meinung nach\u0026hellip; (in my opinion \u0026hellip; )\nIch stimme \u0026hellip; nicht zu, da/weil \u0026hellip; (I disagree with \u0026hellip; , because \u0026hellip;)\nIch bin anderer Meinung (I have a different opinion)\nIch möchte über \u0026hellip; sprechen (I\u0026rsquo;d like to speak about \u0026hellip; )\nZum einen \u0026hellip; zum anderen \u0026hellip; (On the one hand \u0026hellip;, on the other \u0026hellip; )\nZum Abschluss \u0026hellip; (In conclusion \u0026hellip; )\nDanke für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit (Thank you for your attention)\nAnd don\u0026rsquo;t forget the address (Sehr verehrte Frau/Herr Lastname) and sign-off (Mit herzlichen Grüßen) for formal emails!\nI recommend practicing these unnatural exercises a few times so they don\u0026rsquo;t trip you up. And remember to write by hand. When is the last time you wrote hundreds of words by hand? On paper? In ink? Do you even know what a 100-word chunk of your own handwriting looks like?\nI practiced the speaking module a few times If I asked you to deliver a 4-minute speech on say, \u0026ldquo;living in old age\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sustainable tourism\u0026rdquo; in your native language right now, could you do it? Would it have a clear beginning, middle, and end? Structured arguments? A list of possibilities with pros and cons for each, and one possibility described in more detail?\nNo? Yeah, me neither. But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to do for the Goethe B2 speaking module.\nThe other task is a bit less awkward — it\u0026rsquo;s a 5-minute discussion with another test taker based on a prompt. Having a conversation feels a lot more natural than giving a speech.\nWhat about the listening module?\nSo, see, I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually practice the listening module at all. I consider listening my strongest skill so I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother practicing the listening module.\nThat was a mistake. I still did well, but my 93% in listening was my lowest score. The listening exercises were really unnatural for me since I\u0026rsquo;m used to listening to full conversations and not 1-3 contextless sentences floating in the void. Don\u0026rsquo;t be like me — download that audio file and do the listening module once to get used to it, just like the reading module.\nI practiced using the formal-you (Sie) So, I never siezen (use the formal-you for) anybody. I\u0026rsquo;m self-taught and only ever speak to my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family, speaking partners, and tutors around my age. So going into the test, I knew that remembering to use Sie would potentially trip me up on the exam.\nTo practice, I chatted a bit with my boyfriend and my German tutor using Sie in the week before the test.\nOf course, I still messed this up on my exam. But the test proctors didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to mind — I scored 100% in speaking. Which brings me to my next point\u0026hellip;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to be perfect to do well on the B2 German exam Surprised? I was too. But I looked at the grading rubrics for the exam and realized that a 60% was enough to pass each module. Keeping that in mind helped me keep calm — and keep paralyzing perfectionism at bay.\nFor the speaking and writing modules, the best possible score you can achieve still allows for occasional mistakes that don\u0026rsquo;t interfere with understanding. For the 30-question multiple-choice reading and listening sections, you can miss 10 questions and still pass.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a lot of leeway. Don\u0026rsquo;t freak out if you don\u0026rsquo;t know an answer, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Mistakes are allowed, even for perfect scores. Check out the grading rubric to see for yourself.\nSpeaking mistakes are a chance to show off your German And on a related note—if you screw up speaking, your mistake can actually be a chance to guide the conversation towards topics you\u0026rsquo;re more confident speaking about.\nMy speaking partner was high school student, so I went into the conversation 100% expecting to duzen her. But she spoke first and addressed me with Sie, so it would have technically be impolite for me to duzen her back. Needless to say, I slipped up and duzen-ed her multiple times.\nAfter my first slip-up, I stopped in my tracks and turned to the proctors to explain that I\u0026rsquo;ve rarely had to siezen anyone since I mostly speak German with my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family, and that I especially wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to siezen-ing folks my age since I\u0026rsquo;m self-taught.\nExplaining my mistake was a chance to speak fluently about something I was used to talking about—in my case, my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family and teaching myself German.\nSo, prepare a few stock explanations for mistakes you\u0026rsquo;re likely to make. Screw up a word\u0026rsquo;s gender? Explain that you heard it in a YouTube video and never learned its gender. Don\u0026rsquo;t know the translation of \u0026ldquo;House of Representatives?\u0026rdquo; Sorry, you mostly listen to German podcasts about science or art, not US politics. The topic selection was unlucky. Siezen where you should duzen? Whoops, you were just trying to be polite.\nThe takeaway: you don\u0026rsquo;t need to study hard to pass the B2 German exam If you read my blog or follow me on Twitter, you know what\u0026rsquo;s coming next: you don\u0026rsquo;t need some kind of perfectly planned, perfectly executed study plan to ace the B2 German test.\nHeck, I got to C1 German using almost only immersion, which is a nice way of saying listening to podcasts, watching TV, and reading the news.\nA few years of (lots and lots of) comprehensible input supplemented with a bit of speaking and writing practice once you can communicate reasonably well and a week or two of prepping for the exam itself before the test will get you there.\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t stress. Just head over to Netflix and watch another episode of Dark. Or whatever you like watching. That\u0026rsquo;ll help you far more than any hardcore cram-session.\nRelated articles How I chaotically taught myself German to C1 level Are language lessons worth it for beginners?

It is great for vocabulary building and grammar practice, and in the absence of speaking opportunities, it is the only way to get practice with production skills. But beyond simply being a great way to practice on its own, writing is a key component of how I use flashcards and spaced repetition to learn German. In this post, I break down how to use writing practice to get more out of spaced repetition systems like Anki.\nTLDR: Combine Anki or another SRS with writing practice for better flashcards\nBy integrating an SRS into your writing practice, you can learn and remember the grammar, vocabulary, etc. that you struggle with most and avoid wasting time studying things you already know. Simply write in your target language, make mistakes while writing, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards to use with an SRS like Anki. If you use Anki, a simple and fast way to make \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is to make cloze deletions based on the corrected sentence.\nSpaced repetition is a well-studied learning method, and a large body of evidence backs up the claims of the many language bloggers and internet polyglots who tout its benefits. Most modern language learning tools are based on a spaced repetition system (SRS) under the hood, so if you\u0026rsquo;re using Duolingo or Memrise study a language, you\u0026rsquo;ve already have gotten a taste of what spaced repetition is about.\nI use Anki for all of my language flashcards because it is free and very flexible—it works just as well for med students cramming for the MCAT as it does for me as a German learner. This flexibility extends to templating and allows for fun things like automatic color-coding if you hate yourself enough to write out the JavaScript. Check out my Anki templates and decks if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. They\u0026rsquo;re all free.\nWhen used well, an SRS like Anki can be incredibly helpful because it helps you to move concepts from short-term into long-term memory very efficiently, which is exactly what serious language learners need. But using an SRS doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can abandon other study methods. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the most success using Anki when I combine it with other study methods—especially writing.\nThree rules for a healthy flashcard diet The tricky thing about using an SRS like Anki is that it needs to be fed properly. If you use your SRS consistently, you\u0026rsquo;ll remember pretty much everything in your decks. This open-endedness makes SRSs flexible enough to help you learn everything from German verb forms to the bones of the hand, but comes with a downside: Anki doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about what you learn, it just cares that you learn. If you study an unhelpful deck, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn unhelpful things.\nWhat a healthy flashcard diet looks like will be different depending on your needs. But regardless what you\u0026rsquo;re learning, good flashcards will tend to adhere to two basic principles: novelty and relevance.\nNovelty: Flashcards should teach us something we don\u0026rsquo;t already know well Relevance: Flashcards should teach us something useful Simplicity: Flashcards should ask clear \u0026ldquo;questions\u0026rdquo; with straightforward answers (See: minimum information principle) Adhering to novelty, relevance, and simplicity will help you get more out of your SRS whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner learning your first words or a veteran of the B2-plateau like me who needs to focus more on grammar, usage, and more obscure vocab. Incidentally, you can apply these \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; just as well to topics other than language. So go memorize your amino acids or whatever else you\u0026rsquo;re procrastinating on by reading this post.\nBut how to make sure your deck is novel, relevant, and simple?\nI know that there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a split among the langosphere giants when it comes to whether it\u0026rsquo;s best to make your own flashcards or use pre-made decks to save time. And then of course there\u0026rsquo;s the anti-flashcard crowd, but I don\u0026rsquo;t negotiate with terrorists so I won\u0026rsquo;t address any of their points here. I\u0026rsquo;m no polyglot, but my unqualified opinion tends to fall on the make-your-own-flashcards side of the debate, if only for one reason:\nMaking your own flashcards is a good way to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re learning novel and relevant cards.\nThere are some great ready-made flashcard decks out there that, depending on your needs, might already check all three boxes for you. This is especially true for beginners, who often need to learn the same set of core vocabulary when they\u0026rsquo;re just starting out. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve made a bit of progress, the relevance and novelty of ready-made decks falls off fast unless you have a good way of filtering through them. It is very easy to waste time \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; things you either don\u0026rsquo;t need or already know when using decks made by others.\nThis is why making your own flashcards can be so helpful. When you make a deck yourself, you have more control over your flashcard diet.\nThe chicken-and-egg problem of making good flashcards Unfortunately, making good flashcards presents something of a chicken-and-egg problem. Simplicity is usually pretty easy to recognize in cards. If you can\u0026rsquo;t tell what a flashcard is asking you or the answer is complicated enough that you keep getting parts of it right and parts of it wrong, then the card isn\u0026rsquo;t simple enough. But what about novelty and relevance?\nNovel, relevant cards teach us things that we need to learn but don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about something, how can you know whether it is relevant or not? And worse, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know that a certain word or grammar concept exists—even if it might be very relevant to you—how can you know to put it on a flashcard?\nLanguage teachers and courses exist to address these problems. Their job is quite literally to decide what novel information is most relevant for learners at various stages.\nBut language teachers and courses can be expensive or inaccessible. And often, the kind of de-facto \u0026ldquo;relevance\u0026rdquo; imposed by quizzes and sets of vocabulary and grammar topics grouped by chapter/module doesn\u0026rsquo;t align well with real relevance—you could easily end up learning the names of 15 family members you don\u0026rsquo;t have instead of picking up a grammar concept that could move you closer to your specific language goals.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that there\u0026rsquo;s no place for teachers or textbooks iny our learning plan. There probably is a place for them. Their place just isn\u0026rsquo;t dictating 100% of the contents of your flashcard deck.\nWrite in your target language and turn your mistakes into flashcards It would be absurd to sit down and attempt to plan out the content for your cards in advance. Not only would you risk getting caught up in the chicken-and-egg problem, but you\u0026rsquo;d probably also waste a ton of time. Flashcards are just one tool for language learning and, ideally, making them shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a chore that siphons time away from language learning.\nNo, instead of playing teacher and attempting to design a custom curriculum for yourself, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to simply let your flashcards emerge organically as you use your target language. And the best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this is to write.\nWrite, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards.\nWriting preserves our mistakes clearly in text. When we set down a book or finish a show in our target language, we aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a printed-out list of words and phrases that we didn\u0026rsquo;t understand while reading or watching. And while speaking in a new language is notoriously intimidating, it is also more forgiving than writing: when we speak, our mistakes disappear as soon as we stop speaking. But whatever we write has the potential to stick around—mistakes and all—for as long as the paper it was written on or file it was saved in exists.\nThis can make writing intimidating, but it also makes it incredibly useful. Because writing records our mistakes, we can use writing practice as a kind of compass that points towards the grammar and vocabulary you need to learn or review and allows you to avoid wasting time wandering through topics you already understand well.\nCombining writing with an SRS allows your flashcards to emerge organically. Your decks will grow with you, naturally reflecting the way you use your target language and the topics you need the most help learning. If you made a mistake on something, odds are that you don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand it yet. Novelty, check. And the fact that you tried to use it at all indicates that it would have been useful for you to know better. Relevance, check.\nTip: Use cloze deletion to quickly turn mistakes into flashcards\nThe most helpful format that I\u0026rsquo;ve found for \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is also one of the easiest to make: cloze deletions. Cloze deletions are essentially fill-in-the-blank questions. The front of a card has a sentence or other text with some element(s) removed and replaced with a placeholder […]. The back of the card is the whole sentence without deletions.\nGetting your writing corrected by native speakers is easy these days. Here are a few different places to look for corrections. Most are free!\nLangCorrect (free). Correction exchange, usually fast feedback. My go-to. Language subreddits (free). I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German. There are writing-specific subs for some languages as well, like r/WriteStreakGerman. Twitter (free). Certain Twitter communities are full of language learners that are happy to help with requests. Check out #langtwt to find people interested in language who speak your target language. iTalki tutors (cheap). Many will proofread outside of lesson time for a low price per page, just ask. Teachers (only if you\u0026rsquo;re in a course already). If you\u0026rsquo;re taking a class, just use your corrected writing assignments to make flashcards. When it comes to actually making cards out of mistakes, I usually use cloze deletions. Thes are a sort of fill-in-the-blank style flashcard that is very quick to make. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a mistake card I made recently based on corrections from LangCorrect:\nNote that I clozed both adjective endings here. If I had only clozed one, the card would ask a different \u0026ldquo;question\u0026rdquo; than it does currently. The mistake I originally made was knowing whether Wort was neuter or masculine, not whether the adjective endings of gut and deutsch were the same. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give myself too much of a hint by leaving the -es ending on one of the two adjectives, I clozed both endings.\nI mention this just as an example of how you might think about creating your own cards. Be sure to test the mistake you actually made, not a mistake you didn\u0026rsquo;t (even if the card would be a tad simpler that way).\nExample: How I combine writing practice with Anki to make better German flashcards In case you\u0026rsquo;re interested in seeing a concrete implementation of this idea, here\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated Anki into my writing practice:\nEach day, I try (often unsuccessfully) to set aside 30 minutes to write in German. I usually respond to a prompt I find online, or just complain about something that upset me recently. Then I submit my writing to LangCorrect for corrections by native speakers. I usually correct 1-2 submissions by English learners while I\u0026rsquo;m at it to give back and improve the chances that my writing is corrected quickly. Sometimes, I meet with a German tutor on iTalki during the week and we correct a written homework assignment, so I get writing corrections that way as well. Once I get corrections back, I go through them and turn each correction into a flashcard. This is as simple as copy-pasting the corrected sentence into an Anki cloze card and clozing the bits I screwed up. If necessary, I add a hint or translation to the card, but usually the sentence provides enough context on its own. That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s so simple that I wonder now how I managed to write this much about it. That\u0026rsquo;s blogging for you.\n","date":"April 15, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/spaced-repetition-writing/","tags":["anki","language learning tips"],"title":"How to  make better language flashcards by combining writing practice with spaced repetition"},{"categories":["Language Learning","German"],"contents":"German science videos were some of the first \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; German media that I could understand. It might sound like a tough place to start, but thanks to the overlap between English and German scienctific vocabulary, science videos can actually be a great entry into authentic German content (especially if you\u0026rsquo;re a nerd like me). These 10 channels are a great resource for German learners or anyone else looking for awesome science videos in German.\nMany of these channels are supported by German public broadcasters like ZDF, so you can look forward to plenty of ad-free immersion.\nWith that, I hope you nerds enjoy!!\n1. Mailab One of the most famous German-language YouTube channels, Mailab was my gateway drug for German science YouTube. The host, Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim, earned her PhD in chemistry before becoming a full-time science communicator and YouTuber. Her videos cover a wide range of scientific topics relevant to daily life, and she often debunks popular science myths. As a scientist myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been amazed by how clearly Mai communicates complex ideas—not just about science, but about the scientific process as well—without sacrificing accuracy.\nHer video on why and how scientists make mistakes and what that really means the best treatment of this issue tjat I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to find on YouTube—in German or English—to date.\n2. Dinge Erklärt (Kurzgesagt) You might already be familiar with the insanely popular (14+ million subscriber) science and philosophy channel Kurzgesagt, but did you realize that there\u0026rsquo;s a German-language Kurzgesagt channel, too? In fact, the studio behind Kurzgesagt is based in Munich, so you might even consider the German-language channel the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; Kurzgesagt (even though it was started 2 years later and has about 8% of the subscribers).\nMany videos are simply German versions of those on the English channel, but there are a few that are exclusive to one language or the other. This video on homeopathy isn\u0026rsquo;t available in English, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great look at a pretty hot-button issue in Germany.\n3. Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co Terra X, a brand associated with the German public broadcaster ZDF, is essentially the German version of the Discovery Channel…if the Discovery Channel was still producing educational documentaries instead of overproduced docu-series about dudes with weird or dangerous jobs. There are 3 Terra X channels on YouTube, my favorite being Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co.\nLesch\u0026amp;Co is one of the two science-focused arms of the Terra X channel trio, with content made with a more grown-up audience in mind than counterpart Terra X plus. Most of the videos are about physics and astronomy, perhaps because the main host, Harald Lesch, is a walking, talking stereotype of a physicist—sweatervests and all. It\u0026rsquo;s a great channel with interesting videos and a dynamic team of co-hosts including Mai Nguyen-Kim of Mailab.\nFor the classic Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co astrophysics-y experience, check out the playlist \u0026ldquo;Das Weltall erklärt.\u0026rdquo;\nWant more German YouTube channels and other media?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more German YouTube channels, I write a little newsletter that offers up a new recommendaiton for German YouTube channels, movies, TV, music, podcasts, books, and more each week. It\u0026rsquo;s completely free.\n4. Terra X plus Like sister channel Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co, Terra X plus is a science channel from ZDF. The content is intended for school kids and teens, so this channel might be a better choice than Lesch\u0026amp;Co you\u0026rsquo;re just starting to learn German.\nUnlike a lot of science channels, this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t just stick to astrophysics. There\u0026rsquo;s biology, too, like this video on how trees communicate with one another.\n5. Quarks A well-known German science and technology show, but Quarks has kept up with the 21st century trends by making a YouTube channel as well. If you like any of the TerraX channels, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably enjoy Quarks as well. The channel has tons of videos on scientific topics (especially those relevant to everyday life, society and politics) and there are plenty of interesting science history and natural history videos as well.\nI really enjoyed what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far of the \u0026ldquo;Die Geschichte von…\u0026rdquo; series, which isn\u0026rsquo;t always about science but is exactly the kind of thing I remember loving to watch on the Discovery Channel as a kid.\n6. BYTEthinks For the more technically inclined, BYTEthinks is a YouTube channel full of short, byte-sized (haha) videos on technology and science. The video style is fun, mostly consisting of stick-figure style animations and virtual chalkboard diagrams that help clarify complex topics. The channel definitely has a focus on computer science.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? Try BYTEthinks\u0026rsquo; video on artificial intelligence.\n7. Psychologeek Psychology, like many social sciences, often falls victim to twisted interpretation that can lead to persistent, wrong, and sometimes harmful scientific myths. Psychologeek host and psychologist Pia Kabitzsch does a great job breaking down the real science behind popular psychology topics for a wide audience and, when necessary, debunking those pesky myths.\nI loved her video on the ever-popular Myers-Briggs personality types. Decide for yourself whether to file those under psychology fact or potentially harmful myth.\n8. Explainity Explainity isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a science channel–it\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;education project\u0026rdquo; with videos on pretty much anyting complicated enough to require a bit of explaining. The hand-drawn video style is super engaging, and there are plenty of videos on natural science and medicine in addition to Explanity\u0026rsquo;s fantastic content on German politics and society.\nThe video on photosynthesis does a great job walknig through not only the science involved, but also the history behind how photosynthesis was descovered.\n9. AllesPhysik AllesPhysik is a straightforward physics and astronomy YouTube channel. If you liked Cosmos, you might like this: the channel\u0026rsquo;s creator, Thomas, has made almost 20 videos so far on the solar system, space exploration, and the cosmology. Videos are usually short, no more than 10 minutes, so you can definitely squeeze in a bit of German practice with AllesPhysik even if you\u0026rsquo;re pressed for time.\nAllesPhysik\u0026rsquo;s latest video was on discovering habitable exoplants.\n10. Terra X Rounding out the Terra X trio and this list of German science YouTube channels is Terra X (no \u0026ldquo;plus,\u0026rdquo; no \u0026ldquo;Lesch\u0026amp;Co\u0026rdquo;) . It comes in last of the three since it has more of a historical than scientific bent, but there are plenty of good cosmology, earth history, and archaeology videos on the channel as well.\nThe playlist on spaceflight is a good place to look for science videos on this channel.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re already a fan of some of these channels—one even has a popular English counterpart. Or, maybe I missed oned you would have included. Are there any other subjects you\u0026rsquo;d like me to list out some great German YouTube channels about? Do you just want to shame me for writing a listicle? Whatever the case, just drop a comment below if you want to say something. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just to ring the shame bell).\n","date":"March 13, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/german-science-youtube-channels/","tags":["learn german","recommendations","comprehensible input"],"title":"10 Great German Science Youtube Channels"},{"categories":["Language Learning","German"],"contents":"After almost a year of experimentation, I\u0026rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as \u0026ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll say that this is \u0026ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.\u0026rdquo; You can download it for free.\nEmphasis on probably.\nThis template automatically generates cloze-deletions from example sentences, determines the gender of nouns and color-codes accordingly, and recognizes and highlights irregular verbs. It supports images and audio for both German words and example sentences, and has an inutitive input format that uses the same fields for all parts of speech—no special fields for nouns, verbs, etc. that are left blank all the time.\nI released a similar template before, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs. This template works for all German words, and even has some extra features for verbs.\nThe Anki template with example cards is free Pay-what-you-want if you like, but otherwise just enjoy.\nGet the free deck If you notice any issues with the template or have comments, questions, ideas for improvements, or otherwise want to get in touch, please email me at hello@monoglotanxiety.com.\nAbout the template The point of this German Anki template is to make it easier to make well-formatted German flashcards that help you learn better. That means making cloze deletions fast and easy, using an intuitive field setup for quick input, and color-coding nouns and verbs to help you notice and remember the important grammatical properties of these words.\nFeatures Nouns automatically color-coded by gender. The template determines a noun\u0026rsquo;s gender automatically from its definite article (der, die, or das) and color-codes accordingly. Irregular verb forms automatically highlighted. The template highlights irregular verbs by predicting a set of theoretial \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; conjugations and marking any that don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Cloze deletions automatically generated from example sentences. My template uses a little script to predict different forms a word might appear in, search for these forms in the example sentence, and generate a faux cloze deletion by removing the correct word and replacing it with […]. This results in cards that look exactly like traditional clozes but doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any extra clicks or additional note types. Intuitive input with flexible fields that work for nouns, verbs, and everything else. The same set of fields work for every word, regardless of whether it is a verb, noun, or something else. Field order mirrors the typical order in which words and their variants (i.e. plurals, conjugations) are provided in vocabulary lists. Support for images and audio. Cards work without images and audio, but media is added easily. Separate audio for words and example sentences is supported. Cards Translation-to-German: Front - translation, image. Back - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, audio of german word + front German-to-Translation: Front - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, image, audio of German word. Back - translation + front Auto-close: Front - auto-cloze, translation, image. Back - auto-cloze answer, audio of example sentence, German word, info (plural/conjugation) + front I hope this card format makes at least one aspect of your German study routine a bit easier. Flashcards are a super helpful tool, but time spent messing with formatting and making extra cloze deletion cards takes up time that could be better spent actually learning German.\nHow-to guide There are example cards in the deck package that demonstrate how to use the template for nouns (plural-only and normal), verbs, and everything else. Follow the input format demonstrated in those cards and you\u0026rsquo;ll be golden. But just in case something isn\u0026rsquo;t clear, you can read the guidelines below. Shoot me an email at hello@monoglotanxiety.com if you\u0026rsquo;re confused or if you notice a bug.\nAt minimum, you need input for German and Translation. Auto-cloze rand color-coding require both Example and Info (for nouns and verbs) to work properly, and no auto-cloze card is attempted if no example sentence is provided.\nThe \u0026#39;Info\u0026#39; Field\nGerman nouns, verbs, and other words follow different sets of grammatical rules. This template works for all German words because it can determine what kind of word it\u0026rsquo;s dealing with and respond accordingly. The \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field contains grammatical information necessary for the auto-cloze and color-coding functions. For verbs, that means conjugations. For nouns, that means the plural form or a note indicating plural-only nouns. This might sound a bit complicated, but it\u0026rsquo;s intuitive once you see it in action—and a lot nicer to deal with than a bunch of noun- or verb-specific fields that get left empty all the time. Just be sure to look at the examples and take note of the simple rules below to avoid getting frustrated. Pay special attention to how to use the \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field for verbs and nouns.\ngerman: the German word. Nouns should be preceeded by their definite article (der, die, or das) and verbs should be in the infinitive. For reflexive verbs, add sich before the infinitive. Examples: \u0026ldquo;der Hund\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;die Maus\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sprechen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sich wundern\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;abfahren\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;rot\u0026rdquo; info: additional forms/information, usually only relevant for nouns and verbs. Nouns: the plural preceeded by die. If the noun is plural-only write one of p, plural, plural only, or plural-only. For nouns with no plural, leave blank. Examples: die Hunde, die Mäuse, plural, [no input] Verbs: provide the 3rd person present, preterite, and past perfect conjugations in that order, with \u0026ldquo;, \u0026quot; separating the elements. Provide the auxilliary verb. Examples: \u0026ldquo;spricht, sprach, hat gesprochen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wundert sich, wunderte sich, hat sich gewundert\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fährt ab, fuhr ab, ist abgefahren\u0026rdquo; Other: leave blank or use for custom information. translation: the translation example: example sentence. Try to avoid using words that start with the same stem as the word you\u0026rsquo;re quizzing to avoid confusing the auto-cloze (e.x. don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde freuen sich…\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;freuen\u0026rdquo; since Freunde will look like a version of freuen to the auto-cloze script). register: extra field for notes on usage/register. Shown on all card fronts, so be careful with spoilers. Examples: \u0026ldquo;wissenschaftlich\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;österreichisch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gehoben\u0026rdquo; image: an image. If you use attribution text for the image, include it below the picture and it will be displayed in small text beneath the image. german audio: audio file for the german word. example audio: audio file for the example sentence. Known issues Tell me if you find more or if you come up with a fix! Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com\nAuto-cloze mistakes words that begin with verb stems for a version of the verb, and deletes them. Example: Using \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde meinen, dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind.\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;meinen\u0026rdquo; will result in \u0026ldquo;[…] Freunde […], dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind\u0026rdquo;. Work-around: use a different example sentence. Certain adjectives that change stem aren\u0026rsquo;t recognized by auto-cloze. Example: teuer –\u0026gt; teuren is not recognized correctly because the e and r switch places. Work-around: use example sentences that take the base form of these adjectives.

Probably."},{"categories":["Language Learning"],"contents":"Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!\nBut what to write?\nFiguring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible. But even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a writer, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet you write a lot in your native language—it\u0026rsquo;s just not writing of the \u0026ldquo;sit down and fill a page\u0026rdquo; variety. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly shooting off texts, commenting, writing posts, emailing, making to-do-lists, and filling up planners. Why not squeeze some language practice out of those activities?\nThis list of my favorite 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language hits on more traditional methods for improving long-form writing. But I also did my best to make suggestions for ways to weave writing practice into everyday life and get practice writing the short-form, informal texts that fill our inboxes, calendars, and notifications. My hope is that, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a writing enthusiast or the kind of person who only reluctantly picks up a pen, there will be at least one thing this list that will feel approachable to you.\nBut first, there\u0026rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind no matter how you choose to practice!\nThe golden rule of writing practice: get feedback from native speakers Making mistakes helps us learn, and getting corrected ensures that you won\u0026rsquo;t practice being wrong. So when practicing writing in a foreign language, try to focus on writing things that are either public by nature (ex. comments, forum posts) or that you\u0026rsquo;re willing to have corrected by a tutor or on a platform like LangCorrect. Make mistakes out in the open, where someone can notice them and correct you. Usually they\u0026rsquo;ll be nice about it. And if they aren\u0026rsquo;t, you can revel in the knowledge that they unknowingly provided you with free language corrections by trying to be a jerk. If you\u0026rsquo;re nervous, remember that tutors are paid to be nice to you.\nWays to get your writing corrected by native speakers: Post, comment, blog, and otherwise slap your writing down all over the internet in communities full of native speakers. Odds are, if you make an egregious enough mistake, someone will point it out. Reddit is a great place for this kind of practice. Post your writing on a site like LangCorrect, Lang-8, or iTalki to get corrections for free from native speakers. LangCorrect corrections usually come back within a day or so in my experience. Work with a tutor. Watching a piece of your writing get corrected live is a great way to get a good sense for the kinds of errors you tend to make. iTalki is a good place to find online tutors. Ask a friend or language-exchange partner for help once you have a solid relationship in place. The silver rule of writing practice: ignore the golden rule That all said, all writing practice is good writing practice. I keep a journal in German that no one—no one—will ever see. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to see it. Grammar mistakes are one thing, but grammar mistakes in teenage angst at age 23 is another entirely. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do things *s u b o p t i m a l l y* if you want to, and incorperating language practice into things you might already do like keeping a journal or writing out grocery lists is pretty optimal if you ask me.\nOf course, more corrections means more progress. But more writing also means more progress. So whenever you can reasonably write something in your target language instead of your native language, do it—you can think about having someone correct your grocery list or youtube comment later.\nOk, so with that out of the way, here\u0026rsquo;s my list of 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language.\nHappy writing!\n11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language 1. Write an online journal on a language-exchange site There are a number of places online where you can write online journal entries and get them corrected by native speakers for free. Just be nice and correct a few entries in your native language in return. Lang-8, iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, and LangCorrect all offer exactly that. You could also check out the corrections board on the Polyglot Club.\nI personally favor LangCorrect because I feel like I get corrections back quickly and it\u0026rsquo;s obvious that the developers are working hard to steadily improve the site. Also, they seem more interested in making a good experience for people than making money, which is sweet. Unfortunately, Lang-8 isn\u0026rsquo;t taking new users at the time of writing. Also unfortunately, the iTalki community features are currently only fully available on mobile… and I hate typing things on my phone. That seems set to change soon, though.\nAnd as a last note: you can use these sites for more than just journaling. Pretty much anything, even just single sentences, is fair game.\n2. Find a pen pal An oldie but a goodie, exchanging letters or emails with pen pals is a fun way to get to know people from around the world and learn a thing or two about culture in addition to practicing your target language. Writing letters is also a great way to get practice with long-form texts. You can find pen pals on forums for language learners like Polyglot Club and on specialized sites. FluentIn3Months has a nice list of 10 websites where you can look for pen pals. Oh, and check the subreddit for your target language, too. My experience with r/German has been nothing but positive.\n3. Exchange messages with a chat partner Don\u0026rsquo;t want to write out long letters, or would you rather practice writing the way you\u0026rsquo;d actually communicate with someone in every day life? Then consider finding a chat partner to message in your target language. Bilingua, Hellopal, Hellotalk, Speaky, and Tandem are all purpose-built chat apps for language exchange, but there are plenty of other sites where it\u0026rsquo;s possible to connect with chat partners. iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, the subreddit for your target language, and language-learning forums like Polyglot Club are a good place to look for partners as well. And then there\u0026rsquo;s Idyoma, an app which aims at connecting people in the same geographic area for language exchange with the possibility of meeting in real-life—basically Tinder except for language exchange.\n4. Respond to writing prompts There are tons of websites out there with extensive lists of free writing prompts. Search for one in your target language, or just use any of the plentiful English resources out there.\nFor beginners, prompts for kids are fantastic. This prompt generator from My Cup Runs Over is amazing, with options to set your prompt level to elementary, middle, or high-school level. The prompt generator at Langauge is a Virus has plenty of beginner-friendly prompts, too. LangCorrect also has a large list of user-generated prompts, including plenty that are beginner friendly.\nFor intermediate and advanced learners, the New York Times maintains an amazing collection of writing prompts that\u0026rsquo;s available for free without a subscription. The Times also provides list of prompts for students organized by general theme. Resources for writers are also a great place to look for prompts if you have a good command of your target language and are into creative writing. Seventh Sanctum is a classic, and I like The Story Shack\u0026rsquo;s prompt generator a lot too since it provides very clear assignments.\n5. Do the writing exercises in textbooks, practice grammars, and practice exams —you know, those exercises that you skip because you don\u0026rsquo;t have a piece of blank paper on hand? Do them. And then have them corrected by a native speaker.\n6. Keep a bullet journal, planner, or calendar in your target language If you\u0026rsquo;re already writing daily in a planner or bullet journal, switching into your target language—even if not for all of your entries—is a great way to squeeze some extra practice out of an activity you\u0026rsquo;d be doing anyways. Practicing this way has the added benefit of ensuring that you\u0026rsquo;ll learn vocabulary relevant to your life, since that\u0026rsquo;s what goes into a planner or journal.\nBullet journals are a fad worldwide at this point, so you should be able to find a blogger writing about them in your target language and appropriate vocabulary from their posts for things like \u0026ldquo;weekly spread\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to-do list.\u0026rdquo;\n7. Write your to-do lists, grocery lists, and other notes to yourself in your target language Like writing a journal or planner, writing to-do lists and other mundane notes to yourself is a great way to practice the words and phrases most relevant to your life. If you already write lists and notes to yourself, you can get practice without budgeting any extra time for language practice. And if you\u0026rsquo;re really motivated, there\u0026rsquo;s always the option to type up your lists and post them online for corrections from native speakers.\n8. Join subreddits where your target language is used Reddit can be a bit intimidating, but if you can get past the old-school layout and occasionally aggressive users—and they\u0026rsquo;re easy to avoid—it can be a great place to practice a new language. To start, check out the subreddits for your target language. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll find lots of other learners and friendly native speakers who are happy to make minor corrections to posts when they see mistakes. These boards are also a great place to find language exchange partners, and tend to be very friendly. I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German and r/Danish.\nOnce you get a bit more comfortable, branch out and explore other subreddits where people post mainly in your target language. The country-specific subreddits for countries where your language is spoken are safe bets, and there are also more general subreddits specifically for content in various langages. For instance, r/de is for German (and sometimes English) content pertaining to all German-speaking countries. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there though—there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to explore, and especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning a rather \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; language with many speakers you\u0026rsquo;re sure to find all sorts of different subreddits where you can practice posting. Just be sure not to post questions about grammar/language-learning on country subreddits—that\u0026rsquo;s what the language-specific subreddits are for. Check the subreddit rules before posting and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine!\n9. Leave comments on youtube videos, blogs, and other online content in your target language Like posting on Reddit, commenting on your favorite videos, blog posts, and other content in your target langauge is a great way to practice expressing an opininon in your target language and—thanks to the public nature of comments—to get some free corrections. People love pointing out how people are wrong in comments sections, and that extends to grammar. For best results, maybe don\u0026rsquo;t start out by leaping into a heated debate. Some communities are more positive and likely to provide *kind* corrections than others.\nI once got more than 600 likes on a comment I left on a video from a German Late-Night Comedy show, so I\u0026rsquo;m basically famous.\n10. Write example sentences for your flashcards (and use them to make cloze deletions) Being a flashcard junkie, I of course had to throw a flashcard tip into the ring here. One, admittedly nerdy way to get some writing practice is to create example sentences for your flashcards. Example sentences are great on their own, but they\u0026rsquo;re even better when used to create cloze deletions, or cards where the word(s) you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn are removed from a sentence and replaced with a blank. Clozes are a great way to learn words in context. Just be sure to get the sentences corrected by a native speaker so that you don\u0026rsquo;t practice something incorrect.\nThe free spaced-repetition flashcard program I use, Anki, has an easy-to-use cloze deletion format you can use if you just want to create flash cards based no example sentences. Unfortunately, it isn\u0026rsquo;t so straightforward to add cloze deletions to your existing cards if they\u0026rsquo;re not already cloze-format. But if you\u0026rsquo;re learning German, I made a German Anki flashcard format that can figure out where the relevant words are in your example sentences to automatically generates cloze deletions. It color-codes nouns by gender, too. Currently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for nouns, but I have a version with support for verbs coming out soon!\nGet the free template\n11. Contribute to wikipedia pages in your target language I saved the nerdiest suggestion for last. You\u0026rsquo;re almost certainly familiar with Wikipedia already—but have you ever checked out Wikipedia in your target language? Chances are, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of content just waiting to be translated from your native language into your target language. You can get writing practice while simultaneously contributing to making knowledge accessible for free to people around the world.\nTo start with, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to translate content directly out of your native language into your target language. To find pages to edit or create, keep an eye on the sidebar on the left: languages in which a page on the current topic exists are listed. If your target language isn\u0026rsquo;t listed, that means that nobody has made a page in that language yet. And even if there is a page, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees that it will contain all the same information as the page in your native language. Browse through, look for places where you could add in a fact by translating, and then make your edits. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry about making a mistake here or there: if you do make a mistake, someone else can easily fix it later.\nYou can also do this in reverse, translating from your target language into your native language. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of fun translating pages and facts from German Wikipedia into English—like this one on an Austrian satirical political party that advocates for replacing a famous fountian in Vienna with a beer fountain, among other things.\nI hope you enjoyed this list of ways to practice writing in a foreign language.

So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I\u0026rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.\nThis is my honest Pimsleur Danish review after following the course for 30 days. And since I\u0026rsquo;m a nerd, I also worked through German 5 simultaneously to get a sense of how far Pimsleur could take my Danish if I stuck with it. So while this review is about Pimlsuer Danish, it draws on what I learned about Pimsleur generally by skipping ahead in langauge I speak at a higher level than Pimsleur teaches.\nPimsleur Danish Rating: ★★★☆☆ Price: $119.99 for 30 days/15 hrs of audio lessons s $14.99/month with the subscription model Positives\nStarts with speaking from day 1 Listen-and-repeat is great for pronunciation and an especially good fit for Danish Spaced repetition method backed by research Strict 30 min/day goal is motivating Audio format is very convenient - lessons can be done hands-free anywhere you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable speaking and have your smartphone (I did mine in the shower, but it\u0026rsquo;d be perfect for a commute) Negatives\nTeaches tiny amount of vocabulary for 15 hours of study Conversation scenarios are often outdated and sexist and leave out important basics Feels more like memorizing set phrases than learning to speak most of the time Reading lessons are just lists of words to pronounce, not language in context High price (use the subscription version or get Pimsleur from your library) Not directly relevant, but Pimsleur clearly self-promotes on Reddit which enrages me :angry: Summary\nOverall, I can\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed. In a lot of ways, the course seems stuck back in 1963 when it was invented and it definitely falls short of its promise of \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo; conversation in 30 days. There is a real problem with dated social contexts and weirdly blatant sexism. And all those lessons on how to use your sub-A1 Danish to hit on married women in Copenhagen aren\u0026rsquo;t just annoying—they waste valuable space in Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s already slim curriculum. In 30 days, it barely teaches what you\u0026rsquo;d learn in one or two weeks of a textbook course. That said, going through the course did motivate me to start studying Danish again, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all bad. There is a reason Pimsleur is popular. Spaced repetition works, and by the end of 30 days you\u0026rsquo;ll understand basic conversations and have a decent feel for pronunciation. The listen-and-repeat format is convenient and an especially good fit for Danish because of its tricky pronunciation—and this \u0026ldquo;especially good fit\u0026rdquo; is ultimately why I chose to give Pimsleur Danish 3 stars rather than 2.\nAnd for the record, I reccomended Pimsleur to my mom, who is trying to learn Portuguese. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good system for folks who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to study a language on their own and just need to get a sense for how their target language sounds.\nThe basics: how it works and what you\u0026rsquo;ll learn As with other Pimsleur courses, each lesson of Pimsleur Danish consists of a ~30 min audio recording in which you are queued to respond in Danish both to random prompts (i.e. how do you say 56 in Danish?) and in conversational scenarios. Most prompts are given in English. Words are introduced and revisited later, often in slightly new contexts—this is is the spaced repetition method that made Pimsleur famous. When words are introduced, you are asked to repeat after one of the two Danish native speakers (one female, one male) and then you hear the native pronuciation again afterwards. Long words are broken down and introduced from end to beginning, which I found very helpful.\nMost of the lesson involves responding to prompts. You usually aren\u0026rsquo;t given a lot of time to think before one of the speakers says the answer and you\u0026rsquo;re given a chance to repeat it. That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing in my book—it reminds me a lot of how language teachers correct speech by repeating back an incorrect sentence or pronunciation correctly, modeling the correct version of whatever the student was originally trying to say.\nThe Danish course also comes with a reading booklet containing numbered lists of words and corresponding audio files that walk through how to pronounce them. The point of the reading exercises isn\u0026rsquo;t to learn how to read and understand content—many of the words aren\u0026rsquo;t introduced in the Pimsleur course at all, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a translation or context—but rather how to pronounce written Danish. Pronouncing written Danish is hard, so that\u0026rsquo;s important. But reading a list of random words you don\u0026rsquo;t understand isn\u0026rsquo;t a very motivating experience and doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with reading comprehension. I often didn\u0026rsquo;t complete the reading lessons.\nThe conversation scenarios tended to be oriented around the following topics:\nGreetings and saying goodbye Saying that you\u0026rsquo;re American and come from New York \u0026ldquo;I speak a little Danish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Do you speak English?\u0026rdquo; Asking what a word means and asking someone to repeat themselves Words for wife, husband, children, and friends Ordering food/drink at a cafe (a sandwich, coffee, tea, beer, wine, or water) Names of major Danish cities (and a few obscure ones) Telling time Numbers 1-100 Basic travel plans (car-focused, odd for DK) For a 30 day course, the amount of vocabulary covered is very, very small. The first few chapters of any textbook will get you further. And this parcity of vocabulary only makes it all the more confusing that Pimsleur decided to devote a significant chunk of the lessons to topics like…\nYour big German car Gasoline prices How expensive wine is in Denmark \u0026ldquo;Where is Vesterbrogade?\u0026rdquo; Asking women if they\u0026rsquo;re travelling together with their husband Buying Legos for your kids Inviting someone back to your place Inviting someone back to your place after she\u0026rsquo;s said no 5 times The perfect preparation for time travel to Copenhagen in 1963 The original Pimsleur courses were developed by linguist Dr. Paul Pimsleur back in 1963 and adapted for popular consuption in the 1970s. And if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the occasional reference to cellphones, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seem like they\u0026rsquo;ve been updated at all since. The social scenarios and dialogue often feel ripped straight out of the past.\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive a certain degree of conservatism in a language course that\u0026rsquo;s intended to be friendly to government and corperate customers. But the assumption that you\u0026rsquo;re a married upper-class businessman is very much baked into the course content, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not a married upper-class businessman, you\u0026rsquo;ll be left unable to describe yourself or get by in even very basic situations. And what\u0026rsquo;s worse, instead of learning useful things (like, say, the word for \u0026ldquo;food\u0026rdquo;), you waste time rehearsing sexist scripts.\nFor instance, in one lesson I had to ask a woman to come back to my place about 10 times, suggesting a different time of day each time she said no. There are more useful and less disgusting ways to teach time—discussing train schedules, for instance, which would have been a much more \u0026ldquo;travel\u0026rdquo; topic for Denmark than cars and gasoline prices, which is what Pimsleur chose to focus on despite Denmark not being a car country at all.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of Danish 1 but in German 5, there was a lesson that taught vocabulary related to flat tires and roadside assistance. And in in every. single. scenario, the female speaker needed roadside assistance or her husband to change the tire while the male speaker did it himself (often to save his poor wife the trouble of calling for help). Think: \u0026ldquo;I changed the tire, but if my wife had been travelling alone, she would have definitely called for roadside assistance\u0026rdquo; repeated in all its variations for 30 minutes.\nThis focus on cars strikes me as another businessman-bias, since a businessman is just about the only person I could imagine ever renting a car in Denmark (I\u0026rsquo;ll forgive the assumption in car-happy Germany). Pimsleur is really into cars. It taught me how to say \u0026ldquo;I have a big German car\u0026rdquo; before I learned to say where I live, and never touched on planes, trains, bicycles, or busses.\nAnd as one final example of both the sexist tilt and business-class bias, one of the very first things you learn is to ask people back to your place for dinner. I mean, maybe that makes sense if you\u0026rsquo;re a business-class businessman doing a business dinner in your Copenhagen business apartment. But for everyone else… it\u0026rsquo;s just weird. And worse, for a language course with a $120 price tag, it\u0026rsquo;s useless.\nCall me a buzzkill, but I think you should at least learn how to ask someone\u0026rsquo;s name before you start hitting on them in a language you can\u0026rsquo;t speak.\nAn \u0026ldquo;intermediate level\u0026rdquo; in 30 days of Pimsleur? Ok, so… no.\nJust no.\nI took the Danish Modul 1 test while living in Odense, so I have an idea of what you need to know in order to pass the absolute most basic test for Danish learners. The Modul 1 test isn\u0026rsquo;t even an A1-level test—it is sub-A1, a benchmark along the way towards preparing to take the real thing. For those of you not familiar with the CEFR language scale, A1 is the most basic level on a 6-level scale running from A1 to C2. The minimum level that could be considered intermediate would be B1.\nAfter 30 days of Pimsleur Danish alone, you would not be prepared for the Modul 1 test, let alone an A1 exam. So forget about \u0026ldquo;intermediate.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is something that really frustrates me about Pimsleur—and plenty of other language-learning products. I wish they\u0026rsquo;d just be honest with us about what they offered. Because even if Pimsleur was being honest, it would still have a good marketing pitch:\n\u0026ldquo;The perfect companion to classrom or individual study for on-the-go A1-level learners. Speak more spontaneously and improve your accent in just 30 days!\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;d be both honest and more helpful. For an A1 learner, Pimsleur offers a great way to get practice responding quickly in simple conversations and—what I see as its biggest advantage over other programs—to work on pronunciation.\nI wrote something similar in my post on Duolingo a while back, and it really does drive me nuts how often various resources oversell themselves as language-learning panceas. There isn\u0026rsquo;t any one resource out there that will teach you everything. There just isn\u0026rsquo;t. Every tool has its use (and some are more useful than others). Learners could get a lot more out of programs—and could be easily convinced to purchase additional resources—if it was clear exactly what each one was offering.\nBut while everyone oversells, Pimsleur oversells with chutzpah. \u0026ldquo;Converse at an intermediate level in 30 days\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t a promise it can keep—and I sincerely doubt any resource short of matrix-style brain downloads could. This stuff takes time.\nDespite its flaws, there are reasons to use Pimsleur After all this criticism, you might be wondering why I gave Pimsleur Danish 3 stars. And if I were writing this review just for myself and learners like me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rated it so high.\nBut despite that, I still reccomended Pimsleur to my mom. Why?\nFirst, ease of use: a course you can listen to while driving, cleaning, cooking, showering, gardening, petting a cat, or really anything else that doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with your ability to hear and speak requires almost no activation energy to use. And the fact that Pimsleur limits you to 30 minutes per day of study is hugely motivating for people who tend not to start learning new things because they find them intimidating (so most of us). It\u0026rsquo;s clear what you should to to learn each day and that makes it easier to stick with Pimsleur than, say, Duolingo, which allows you to set your own goals or none at all.\nSecond, Pimsleur teaches listening and pronunciation. If you\u0026rsquo;re not going to cough up the cash for lessons with a native speaker or find a language exchange partner somewhere, Pimsleur can help fill in some of the gaps when it comes to those very important skills. Of course, actually speaking is always, always going to be better than rehearsing conversations. But letting perfection get in the way of good enough is a terrible strategy no matter what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad Pimsleur and courses like it are out there for folks who can\u0026rsquo;t afford or arrange one-on-one time with native speakers. My mom could have found a tutor on iTalki, but realistically I know she\u0026rsquo;d be too embarassed to start from 0 in real conversations. And since I didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German for about a year after I started studying it, I understand the impulse. I\u0026rsquo;m not making that mistake with Danish and I really do reccomend speaking with a real person over an audio course if you can.\nThird, spaced repetition works, and even if you won\u0026rsquo;t learn very much vocabulary with Pimsleur you\u0026rsquo;re likely to remember the vocabulary you do learn. It\u0026rsquo;s a good foundation for building upon, and getting those first few words and \u0026ldquo;conversations\u0026rdquo; out of the way builds confidence. Spaced repetition also contributes to making Pimsleur a positive, motivating experience—it feels great to feel like you have answers to simpel questions on the tip of your tongue, and that\u0026rsquo;s what spaced repetition gives you in Pimsleur (although the responses are more rehearsed than spontaneous… which is why I see this as more of a motivation helper than a good language-learning strategy)\nSo yes, there are reasons the Pimsleur courses have stood the test of time and remain so popular despite their flaws.\nPimsleur costs too much, but there are (100% legal) ways to get around that problem If you think Pimsleur is the course for you, please, please don\u0026rsquo;t do what I did and pay $120 for 15 hours of audio lessons. I could have booked 8 lessons with my Danish iTalki tutor for that much. For what Pimsleur is, the price is too high. A lot of the price is definitely the brand.\nLuckily, there are some (legal, put away your pirate flags) options out there for getting around the price tag.\nFirst, Pimsleur offers a subscription version of its courses for $14.99/month. You get access to all of the material for a given language for as long as you\u0026rsquo;re subscribed—you just don\u0026rsquo;t get to keep the course afterwards. Since Danish has only one 30-day course, you\u0026rsquo;d only need to pay $15 to do the whole course over one month with the subscription model. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a totally fair price for what Pimsleur is. Almost 10x the price just to keep the recordings (which you should not listen to more than once anyways) isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it any way you slice it.\nAnother alternative is to check your library—thanks to Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s fame and long-time popularity, it\u0026rsquo;s a common item in library catalogues in the US. My library didn\u0026rsquo;t have all 5 German courses, but it had the first 3 and Danish as well.\nWhat do you think? Was this Pimsleur Danish review helpful?

You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you\u0026rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom… This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nDuolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t bad if you use it effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet–you get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking Süddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired my Duolingo habit.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo—if you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\nOwl trophy image from https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/8613388/I-Have-Conquered-My-German-Treewith, edited by me\n","date":"December 8, 2020","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/is-duolingo-bad/","tags":["language resources","language learning tips","language apps"],"title":"Is Duolingo bad?"}]
