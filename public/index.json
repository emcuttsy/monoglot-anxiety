    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn\u0026rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have tried, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.\nDespite having studied the language for 2 years, I could barely understand him at the beginning. But with time, I learned to learned to map his upper-Austrian dialect onto my patchy foreigner\u0026rsquo;s Hochdeutsch. That was the easy part. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning to stop worrying about making mistakes—and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized how important it is that I do.\nScrewing up is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe even necessary. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing it when it comes to learning. I can almost feel my brain tying neurons together in a frenzy of embarrased desparation every time I\u0026rsquo;m corrected.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the idea behind \u0026ldquo;Fehler Files,\u0026rdquo; a new series I\u0026rsquo;m kicking off in this post. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing real ways I\u0026rsquo;ve screwed up speaking German in short posts so you can experience that feeling embarrased desparation vicariously (though I won\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s a substitute for the real deal. Go find your own person to point out all your flaws—grammatical and otherwise—for you, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing better). It will hopefully add up to something like a collection of bite-sized grammar reviews of topics that are both tricky and common enough to give a B1/B2-level speaker trouble.\nTo start things off, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how I\u0026rsquo;ve butchered the German dative plural.\nIch lerne Deutsch seit zwei Jahr…e…en. And I still can\u0026rsquo;t remember the dative plural One of the mistakes I notice myself getting corrected on most frequently is missing ns on my dative plurals. Take this example from a moment when I embarrrased myself trying to compensate for my monoglualism by pointing out how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come with German in two years…\n \u0026ldquo;Ich bringe mir seit nur zwei Jahre Deutch bei und habe bereits das Niveau B2 erre–\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Was?\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en, nicht Jahr-e. Du bringst dir seit zwei Jahren Deutch bei.\u0026quot;\n That sneaky \u0026ldquo;-n\u0026rdquo; marks the dative plural, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I often forget it when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about lengths of time. I suspect that this is because many of the German prepositions used to talk about time take the dative case, and we often talk about time in terms of plural units (seconds, days, months, years, etc.).\nSo, here\u0026rsquo;s a reminder—to you and to me—that the dative plural exists! And it does show up in a lot of contexts (especially to indicate the indirect object of verbs and with certain prepositions), so it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember.\nThe dative plural Making the dative plural is simple: Add an \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; to the end of the nominative plural. If the word ends in -n (i.e. Gärten) already, or ends in -s (i.e. Autos), don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. Remembering not to add the -n to plurals ending in -s isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard, because \u0026ldquo;Autosn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Opasn\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right.\n   nom. Singular Nom. Plural Dat. Plural     der Mann die Männer den Männern   das Jahr die Jahre den Jahren   die Maus die Mäuse den Mäusen   die Frau die Frauen den Frauen (no change)    As a reminder, the definite for the dative plural is den. The indefinite plural takes no article (called the \u0026ldquo;null article\u0026rdquo;). And the dative plural is very consistent. All the adjectives and articles that come a dative plural noun also end in \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;.\nDer Lehrer hilft den jungen Kindern. The teacher helps the young children.\nDie Jägerin versteckt sich zwischen den grünen Bäumen. The huntress is hiding between the green trees.\nEs ist den kleinen Mädchen kalt.\nThe little girls are cold.\nQuick reminder: when to use the dative Flip open any German grammar book and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the main three uses of the dative case are:\n indicating indirect objects of verbs (ex. Ich gebe den Pferden einen Apfel) indicating who is affected by a verb\u0026rsquo;s action (ex. Sie schrieb ihnen einen Brief) indicating possession of body parts, articles of clothing, prized possessions, and close relatives (ex.Den Waisenkindern sind gerade die Eltern gestorben) following many prepositions (ex. zu, mit, seit, nach, etc.)  I won\u0026rsquo;t go into these here now, since I plan on coming back to the dative case later and breaking each of these down in more detail in regular posts.\n",

    "description": "A blog about language and language learning that doesn't take itself too seriously",
    "body": "Being the good cornfed American girl that I am, I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn a second language growing up, and I ended up develop a nasty case of I now affectionately call monoglot anxiety: a sort of wallowing, often jealous panic surrounding having never learned to speak a second language, and fear of inevitably screwing up all the time if I did try to learn one.\nFor years, it held me back, but eventually, it drove me bonkers enough to grind to the end of Duolingo German.\nAnxiety is, for the record, never the best reason to do anything (and Duolingo is, for the record, not necessarily the best way to start learning a language). But in the absence of other motivators, anxiety sometimes gets the job done.\nAnyways, one thing led to another and now I have a language blog.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I can\u0026rsquo;t humble-brag on the 15 languages I\u0026rsquo;ve taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So you won\u0026rsquo;t find promises of fluency in X amount of time here, nor any #inspiration. You will find what I hope is an entertaining take on language and language learning, written by someone who\u0026rsquo;s in this for fun, not perfection.\nAside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you\u0026rsquo;ve taught yourself 15 languages\u0026hellip; But just because you\u0026rsquo;ve earned it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I have to like it!\n I write about all sort of language topics, but this blog definitely has a specific focus on German. I share a lot of German-specific tips and resources, including new Anki decks and vocabulary lists every two weeks.\n",
