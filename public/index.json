    "description": "The listening-based approach is good for phonetically-tricky Danish, but the dialogue is weirdly irrelevant unless your primary motivation for learning Danish is to pick up girls abroad.",
    "body": "I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I\u0026rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.\nThis is my honest review of Pimsleur Danish after following the course for 30 days. And since I\u0026rsquo;m a nerd, I also worked through German 5 simultaneously to get a sense of how far Pimsleur could take my Danish if I stuck with it. So while this review is about Pimlsuer Danish, it draws on what I learned about Pimsleur generally by skipping ahead in langauge I speak at a higher level than Pimsleur teaches.\nOverview: Pimsleur Danish Rating: ★★★☆☆  Positives\n Starts with speaking from day 1 Listen-and-repeat is great for pronunciation and an especially good fit for Danish Spaced repetition method backed by research Strict 30 min/day goal is motivating Audio format is very convenient - lessons can be done hands-free anywhere you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable speaking and have your smartphone (I did mine in the shower, but it\u0026rsquo;d be perfect for a commute)  Negatives\n Teaches tiny amount of vocabulary for 15 hours of study Conversation scenarios are often outdated and sexist and leave out important basics Feels more like memorizing set phrases than learning to speak most of the time Reading lessons are just lists of words to pronounce, not language in context High price (use the subscription version or get Pimsleur from your library) Not directly relevant, but Pimsleur clearly self-promotes on Reddit which enrages me 😠  Summary\nOverall, I can\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed. In a lot of ways, the course seems stuck back in 1963 when it was invented and it definitely falls short of its promise of \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo; conversation in 30 days. There is a real problem with dated social contexts and weirdly blatant sexism. And all those lessons on how to use your sub-A1 Danish to hit on married women in Copenhagen aren\u0026rsquo;t just annoying—they waste valuable space in Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s already slim curriculum. In 30 days, it barely teaches what you\u0026rsquo;d learn in one or two weeks of a textbook course. That said, going through the course did motivate me to start studying Danish again, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all bad. There is a reason Pimsleur is popular. Spaced repetition works, and by the end of 30 days you\u0026rsquo;ll understand basic conversations and have a decent feel for pronunciation. The listen-and-repeat format is convenient and an especially good fit for Danish because of its tricky pronunciation—and this \u0026ldquo;especially good fit\u0026rdquo; is ultimately why I chose to give Pimsleur Danish 3 stars rather than 2.\nAnd for the record, I reccomended Pimsleur to my mom, who is trying to learn Portuguese. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good system for folks who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to study a language on their own and just need to get a sense for how their target language sounds.\nThe basics: how it works and what you\u0026rsquo;ll learn As for other Pimsleur courses, each lesson Pimsleur Danish consists of a ~30 min audio recording in which you are queued to respond in Danish both to random prompts (i.e. how do you say 56 in Danish?) and in conversational scenarios. Most prompts are given in English. Words are introduced and revisited later, often in slightly new contexts—this is is the spaced repetition method that made Pimsleur famous. When words are introduced, you are asked to repeat after one of the two Danish native speakers (one female, one male) and then you hear the native pronuciation again afterwards. Long words are broken down and introduced from end to beginning, which I found very helpful.\nMost of the lesson involves responding to prompts. You usually aren\u0026rsquo;t given a lot of time to think before one of the speakers says the answer and you\u0026rsquo;re given a chance to repeat it. That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing in my book—it reminds me a lot of how language teachers correct speech by repeating back an incorrect sentence or pronunciation correctly, modeling the correct version of whatever the student was originally trying to say.\nThe Danish course also comes with a reading booklet containing numbered lists of words and corresponding audio files that walk through how to pronounce them. The point of the reading exercises isn\u0026rsquo;t to learn how to read and understand content—many of the words aren\u0026rsquo;t introduced in the Pimsleur course at all, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a translation or context—but rather how to pronounce written Danish. Pronouncing written Danish is hard, so that\u0026rsquo;s important. But reading a list of random words you don\u0026rsquo;t understand isn\u0026rsquo;t a very motivating experience and doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with reading comprehension. I often didn\u0026rsquo;t complete the reading lessons.\nThe conversation scenarios tended to be oriented around the following topics:\n Greetings and saying goodbye Saying that you\u0026rsquo;re American and come from New York \u0026ldquo;I speak a little Danish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Do you speak English?\u0026rdquo; Asking what a word means and asking someone to repeat themselves Words for wife, husband, children, and friends Ordering food/drink at a cafe (a sandwich, coffee, tea, beer, wine, or water) Names of major Danish cities (and a few obscure ones) Telling time Numbers 1-100 Basic travel plans (car-focused, odd for DK)  For a 30 day course, the amount of vocabulary covered is very, very small. The first few chapters of any textbook will get you further. And this parcity of vocabulary only makes it all the more confusing that Pimsleur decided to devote a significant chunk of the lessons to topics like…\n Your big German car Gasoline prices How expensive wine is in Denmark \u0026ldquo;Where is Vesterbrogade?\u0026rdquo; Asking women if they\u0026rsquo;re travelling together with their husband Buying Legos for your kids Inviting someone back to your place Inviting someone back to your place after she\u0026rsquo;s said no 5 times  The perfect preparation for time travel to Copenhagen in 1963 The original Pimsleur courses were developed by linguist Dr. Paul Pimsleur back in 1963 and adapted for popular consuption in the 1970s. And if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the occasional reference to cellphones, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seem like they\u0026rsquo;ve been updated at all since. The social scenarios and dialogue often feel ripped straight out of the past.\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive a certain degree of conservatism in a language course that\u0026rsquo;s intended to be friendly to government and corperate customers. But assumption that you\u0026rsquo;re a married upper-class businessman is very much baked into the course content, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not a married upper-class businessman, you\u0026rsquo;ll be left unable to describe yourself or get by in even very basic situations. And what\u0026rsquo;s worse, instead of learning useful things (like, say, the word for \u0026ldquo;food\u0026rdquo;), you waste time rehearsing sexist scripts.\nFor instance, in one lesson I had to ask a woman to come back to my place about 10 times, suggesting a different time of day each time she said no. There are more useful and less disgusting ways to teach time—discussing train schedules, for instance, which would have been a much more \u0026ldquo;travel\u0026rdquo; topic for Denmark than cars and gasoline prices, which is what Pimsleur chose to focus on despite Denmark not being a car country at all.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of Danish 1 but in German 5, there was a lesson that taught vocabulary related to flat tires and roadside assistance. And in in every. single. scenario, the female speaker needed roadside assistance or her husband to change the tire while the male speaker did it himself (often to save his poor wife the trouble of calling for help). Think: \u0026ldquo;I changed the tire, but if my wife had been travelling alone, she would have definitely called for roadside assistance\u0026rdquo; repeated in all its variations for 30 minutes.\nThis focus on cars strikes me as another businessman-bias, since a businessman is just about the only person I could imagine ever renting a car in Denmark (I\u0026rsquo;ll forgive the assumption in car-happy Germany). Pimsleur is really into cars. It taught me how to say \u0026ldquo;I have a big German car\u0026rdquo; before I learned to say where I live, and never touched on planes, trains, bicycles, or busses.\nAnd as one final example of both the sexist tilt and business-class bias, one of the very first things you learn is to ask people back to your place for dinner. I mean, maybe that makes sense if you\u0026rsquo;re a business-class businessman doing a business dinner in your Copenhagen business apartment. But for everyone else… it\u0026rsquo;s just weird. And worse, for a language course with a $120 price tag, it\u0026rsquo;s useless.\nCall me a buzzkill, but I think you should at least learn how to ask someone\u0026rsquo;s name before you start hitting on them in a language you can\u0026rsquo;t speak.\nAn \u0026ldquo;intermediate level\u0026rdquo; in 30 days of Pimsleur? Ok, so… no.\nJust no.\nI took the Danish Modul 1 test while living in Odense, so I have an idea of what you need to know in order to pass the absolute most basic test for Danish learners. The Modul 1 test isn\u0026rsquo;t even an A1-level test—it is sub-A1, a benchmark along the way towards preparing to take the real thing. For those of you not familiar with the CEFR language scale, A1 is the most basic level on a 6-level scale running from A1 to C2. The minimum level that could be considered intermediate would be B1.\nAfter 30 days of Pimsleur Danish alone, you would not be prepared for the Modul 1 test, let alone an A1 exam. So forget about \u0026ldquo;intermediate.\u0026quot;\nThis is something that really frustrates me about Pimsleur—and plenty of other language-learning products. I wish they\u0026rsquo;d just be honest with us about what they offered. Because even if Pimsleur was being honest, it would still have a good marketing pitch:\n \u0026ldquo;The perfect companion to classrom or individual study for on-the-go A1-level learners. Speak more spontaneously and improve your accent in just 30 days!\u0026rdquo;\n That\u0026rsquo;d be both honest and more helpful. For an A1 learner, Pimsleur offers a great way to get practice responding quickly in simple conversations and—what I see as its biggest advantage over other programs—to work on pronunciation.\nI wrote something similar in my post on Duolingo a while back, and it really does drive me nuts how often various resources oversell themselves as language-learning panceas. There isn\u0026rsquo;t any one resource out there that will teach you everything. There just isn\u0026rsquo;t. Every tool has its use (and some are more useful than others). Learners could get a lot more out of programs—and could be easily convinced to purchase additional resources—if it was clear exactly what each one was offering.\nBut while everyone oversells, Pimsleur oversells with chutzpah. \u0026ldquo;Converse at an intermediate level in 30 days\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t a promise it can keep—and I sincerely doubt any resource short of matrix-style brain downloads could. This stuff takes time.\nDespite its flaws, there are reasons to use Pimsleur After all this criticism, you might be wondering why I gave Pimsleur Danish 3 stars. And if I were writing this review just for myself and learners like me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rated it so high.\nBut despite that, I still reccomended Pimsleur to my mom. Why?\nFirst, ease of use: a course you can listen to while driving, cleaning, cooking, showering, gardening, petting a cat, or really anything else that doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with your ability to hear and speak requires almost no activation energy to use. And the fact that Pimsleur limits you to 30 minutes per day of study is hugely motivating for people who tend not to start learning new things because they find them intimidating (so most of us). It\u0026rsquo;s clear what you should to to learn each day and that makes it easier to stick with Pimsleur than, say, Duolingo, which allows you to set your own goals or none at all.\nSecond, Pimsleur teaches listening and pronunciation. If you\u0026rsquo;re not going to cough up the cash for lessons with a native speaker or find a language exchange partner somewhere, Pimsleur can help fill in some of the gaps when it comes to those very important skills. Of course, actually speaking is always, always going to be better than rehearsing conversations. But letting perfection get in the way of good enough is a terrible strategy no matter what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad Pimsleur and courses like it are out there for folks who can\u0026rsquo;t afford or arrange one-on-one time with native speakers. My mom could have found a tutor on iTalki, but realistically I know she\u0026rsquo;d be too embarassed to start from 0 in real conversations. And since I didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German for about a year after I started studying it, I understand the impulse. I\u0026rsquo;m not making that mistake with Danish and I really do reccomend speaking with a real person over an audio course if you can.\nThird, spaced repetition works, and even if you won\u0026rsquo;t learn very much vocabulary with Pimsleur you\u0026rsquo;re likely to remember the vocabulary you do learn. It\u0026rsquo;s a good foundation for building upon, and getting those first few words and \u0026ldquo;conversations\u0026rdquo; out of the way builds confidence. Spaced repetition also contributes to making Pimsleur a positive, motivating experience—it feels great to feel like you have answers to simpel questions on the tip of your tongue, and that\u0026rsquo;s what spaced repetition gives you in Pimsleur (although the responses are more rehearsed than spontaneous… which is why I see this as more of a motivation helper than a good language-learning strategy)\nSo yes, there are reasons the Pimsleur courses have stood the test of time and remain so popular despite their flaws.\nPimsleur costs too much, but there are (100% legal) ways to get around that problem If you think Pimsleur is the course for you, please, please don\u0026rsquo;t do what I did and pay $120 for 15 hours of audio lessons. I could have booked 8 lessons with my Danish iTalki tutor for that much. For what Pimsleur is, the price is too high. A lot of the price is definitely the brand.\nLuckily, there are some (legal, put away your pirate flags) options out there for getting around the price tag.\nFirst, Pimsleur offers a subscription version of its courses for $14.99/month. You get access to all of the material for a given language for as long as you\u0026rsquo;re subscribed—you just don\u0026rsquo;t get to keep the course afterwards. Since Danish has only one 30-day course, you\u0026rsquo;d only need to pay $15 to do the whole course over one month with the subscription model. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a totally fair price for what Pimsleur is. Almost 10x the price just to keep the recordings (which you should not listen to more than once anyways) isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it any way you slice it.\nAnother alternative is to check your library—thanks to Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s fame and long-time popularity, it\u0026rsquo;s a common item in library catalogues in the US. My library didn\u0026rsquo;t have all 5 German courses, but it had the first 3 and Danish as well.\nWhat do you think? Have you tried out Pimsleur Danish yourself, or are you thinking of giving it a shot? Let me know in the comments below, and thanks for reading!\n",

    "description": "Many of the terms Americans often use to talk about education just don't translate well to German. Don't get confused by false friends like Klasse like I did!",
    "body": "How do you say \u0026ldquo;class of 2020\u0026rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you\u0026rsquo;re from the US.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a \u0026ldquo;class,\u0026rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year. It\u0026rsquo;s such a basic concept in the US education system that I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how odd it can sometimes be until I had to explain it to my tutor earlier this week.\nFor anyone who either didn\u0026rsquo;t go to school in the States or hasn\u0026rsquo;t watched enough American high school dramas to have figured this out: we here in the US primarily group students into social groups based on 1-year age differentials instead of on, say, common interests and course requirements (though students often socialize based on those things, too). This makes a bit more sense here than it might elsewhere, since it is typical for students beginning university to take a set of common classes (often called \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; classes) in a wide range of subjects before specializing. So you do tend to meet a lot of people who started studying in your year. And there are also things like fraternity and sorority culture, sports, student organizations, and other campus-life factors that further serve to separate students by year. It\u0026rsquo;s typical to ask someone their class when getting to know them—are you a freshman (1st year)? No, I\u0026rsquo;m a senior (4th year).\nPerhaps the most bizzare aspect of the \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; idea is that it often sticks with you long after you\u0026rsquo;ve finished studying. If all goes according to the usual plan, most of the friends you make while studying will belong to your class. Look around any college town or campus and you\u0026rsquo;ll find all sorts of little plaques indicating that whatever building or statue or bench (it\u0026rsquo;s often a bench) you\u0026rsquo;re looking at was paid for by the class of 1997 or 1960 or 2019 to commemorate their wonderful time together. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t unusual for high schools and universities to hold reunions in which alumni from a certain class come back together after 5, 10, or 20 years to judge one another on how poorly they\u0026rsquo;ve aged and enjoy the sweet, sweet schadenfreude that comes from seeing the guy who made fun of your braces in 10th grade gaze jealously at your new Tesla on his way out to the bus stop. The US is truly the greatest country on Earth.\nAnyhow, this concept doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the German-speaking world. And while the two words sound similar and both pertain to education, Klasse and \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; are false friends. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned from my tutor about how to talk about groups of classmates in German.\nWhat does die Klasse mean in German? Although Klasse sounds like the English word \u0026ldquo;class,\u0026rdquo; the two words rarely refer to the same thing. Eine Klasse is a group of school-age students who receive lessons together in the same classroom. It is not a lesson, lecture, series of lessons/lectures, or group of students who will graduate in the same year, and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use Klasse to refer to groups of university students.\nOne translation for Klasse in this context might be \u0026ldquo;classroom\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;classroom group.\u0026rdquo; In Germany and Austria, school-age students of the same age in school are separated into groups that are taught together. This is similar to how elementary school classes in the US are organized, except instead of a single teacher being responsible for each class the students are instructed in the various subjects by different teachers who rotate through the classrooms. Students in one Klasse don\u0026rsquo;t often interract with students in other Klassen, except if they take elective classes like Latin together.\nDer Jahrgang refers to students who started studying in the same year, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the same thing as an English \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the closest German translation of \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; in the sense of \u0026ldquo;class of 2020\u0026rdquo; is der Jahrgang—but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean exactly the same thing. Almost anything can have a Jahrgang. It refers simply to the group of all of a kind that were produced or born in the same year. \u0026ldquo;Vintage\u0026rdquo; might be a good translation for cases involving objects, as in the vintage of a wine, car, or design. When referring to students, a Jahrgang is a group of students who started studying in the same year. If Jahrgang is followed by a year, the year refers to when the students began studying, not when they graduated. So, if you were in the class of 2020, you\u0026rsquo;d be in Jahrgang 2016.\nHowever, unlike in the US, a student\u0026rsquo;s Jahrgang isn\u0026rsquo;t very important in German-speaking countries at the university level. Like elsewhere in Europe, students don\u0026rsquo;t take many courses together just because they\u0026rsquo;re the same age—by the time they start at university, they\u0026rsquo;ve already specialized. So there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;freshman core\u0026rdquo; everyone goes through together, and it is very rare for students to take courses outside of their major. And because it is common for students to have a lot of choice about the order in which they take their courses, study year isn\u0026rsquo;t as much of a natural division between students as it is in the US.\nYour Studienrichtung is likely more revelvant than your Jahrgang It is more typical for European students to think of themselves as belonging to a cohort of students in the same major subject as in the same study year. In German, die Studienrichtung means course of study or \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; in US English. Other words you might hear are der Studiengang and der Studienfach. The three words are roughly equivalent. In most circumstances, your course of study is far more relevant in terms of who you meet and spend time with at university than your class.\nIt seems there just isn\u0026rsquo;t a 1:1 translation of \u0026ldquo;Class of 2020\u0026rdquo; to German. This is just one example of how learning a bit about culture and society isn\u0026rsquo;t just a fun add-on to language learning—having a little context is helpful, sometimes even necessary, for understanding a new language.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Words to make sure you're prepared for your next trip to a Biergarten, with an Anki deck and a funny song to help you remember them—even after a few drinks",
    "body": "Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I\u0026rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.\nGiven that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beer—so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor\u0026rsquo;s Travel forum: can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?\u0026quot; Is it even possible?\nThe answer, by the way, is no. I\u0026rsquo;m not so into beer myself, and I tried to visit Germany dry once. But the border checkpoint guy won\u0026rsquo;t let you through unless you finish off a full liter of beer (but not French beer) in front of him. Extra points if you drink it out of a boot.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;ll definitely need these words…\nJokes aside, if you do ever end up drunk in germanophone company and decide to flex your language skills, you can get by just fine with betrunken alone. An extensive list of synonyms is probably the last thing you\u0026rsquo;ll remember then anyways. But at least you\u0026rsquo;ll be well prepared to explain yourself the next day!\nThe angeheitert-hinüber continuum of German drunkness, with usage notes from a native speaker While all of these words mean \u0026ldquo;drunk,\u0026rdquo; they aren\u0026rsquo;t all equivalent. Just like \u0026ldquo;tipsy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;inebriated,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;smashed\u0026rdquo; mean different things and are in very different registers, German words like beschwipst and besoffen mean very different things and aren\u0026rsquo;t used in the same context. Manyare considered slang and could be rude in certain contexts, and others are more formal and more likely to show up in a newspaper than in conversation.\nBecause drunkness is apparently pretty nuanced in German, I recruited my boyfriend to use his native speaker\u0026rsquo;s ear to sort these from least-drunk to most-drunk. He was sweet enough to help out, and provided some notes on connotation as well. But be warned: he\u0026rsquo;s Austrian, and Austrian German (or \u0026ldquo;cool German\u0026rdquo; as Clemens says) can be very different from German-German. So blame him if you raise a few eyebrows after whipping out one of these words in German company. The \u0026ldquo;super Austrian\u0026rdquo; words are marked with a little flag. 🇦🇹\nWords are listed from least to most drunk, from angeheitert to hinüber (which can literally mean dead). Clemens' notes on usage are in parentheses. If you want to have a shot at remembering these in an appropriate context, check out the free Anki deck. I\u0026rsquo;ve also made a premium version with cloze deletions, color coding for nouns and irregular verb forms, and images that you can pick up for $2 or pay-what-you-want.\n  Get the Anki deck!\n I only ask for a few dollars because of the card format. I put a lot of love (and anxiety) into making it and there will be a post introducing the template soon. If you pick up the premium version of the deck, you can re-use the included template to speed up your deck building! There\u0026rsquo;s also a free version of the template that you can try out—it has many of the same features, but just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs.\nAnyways, with all that said: Prost!\n18 ways to say \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; in German  angeheitert buzzed, happy angetrunken - buzzed (\u0026ldquo;feeling the alcohol already a bit\u0026rdquo;) beschwipst - tipsy, a little drunk and acting silly benebelt - befuddled, a little drunk and confused because of it eingespritzt - [🇦🇹] mildly drunk (\u0026ldquo;has drunk something\u0026rdquo;) alkoholisiert - [formal] intoxicated \u0026ldquo;only used by police and newspapers\u0026rdquo;) betrunken - drunk (\u0026ldquo;this is what happens if you continue with trinken\u0026rdquo;) berauscht - [very formal] inebriated angesoffen - [very slangy] pretty drunk in meinem Öl - [🇦🇹 very slangy] pretty drunk, in my drunkenness (\u0026ldquo;synonym for angesoffen\u0026rdquo;) besoffen - [very informal] sloshed paniert - [🇦🇹 slang] very drunk (\u0026ldquo;sehr österreichisch, also used for schnitzl\u0026rdquo;) blau - sloshed (\u0026ldquo;strong word\u0026rdquo;) zu - [very informal] sloshed (\u0026ldquo;synonym for dicht, blau, besoffen, and voll\u0026rdquo;) dicht - [very informal], sloshed, also means high (\u0026ldquo;good word\u0026rdquo;) voll - [very informal], sloshed, full fett - [🇦🇹 very informal] wasted (\u0026ldquo;very Austrian, there\u0026rsquo;s a song about it\u0026rdquo;) hinüber - incredibly wasted (\u0026ldquo;also means dead, Austrians would say hinig\u0026quot;)  Hear some of these words in action in this very Austrian song 🇦🇹 🍻   Did you get any of that? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you didn\u0026rsquo;t. Österreichisch can sometimes sound like a completely different language from Standard German—and there isn\u0026rsquo;t just one Österreichisch, either since there are lots of dialects just like in the rest of the German-speaking world. Still, listen to this stuff long enough and it starts to sound more like German. Looking at the lyrics while listening along can help a lot.\nThe song is pretty funny and worth deciphering. To get you started, the title in Standard German would be \u0026ldquo;heute bin ich wieder fett wie ein Radierer.\u0026rdquo; Not to give away the joke, but the song is roughly about how \u0026ldquo;drunk goggles\u0026rdquo; can sometimes have rose-colored lenses.\nAnd even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand or like the song, check out the comments section for a laugh. The comments sections on old Austrian songs are like some kind of bizzare oasis in the filth ocean of youtube comments sections—they\u0026rsquo;re always super wholesome. Everyone just seems to want to wave little mini Austrian flags along to the beat and share sentimental childhood memories.

While you might not need them to play the game, booster packs what make it fun (or addictive?).\nLearning vocabulary isn\u0026rsquo;t so different. You can get by with just the necessary words and should definitely focus on high-frequency vocabulary to start. But it\u0026rsquo;s the unnecessary words that make learning the necessary ones worth it.\nThe idea behind these vocabulary booster packs is to compile words that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t usually find in vocabulary list but that are fun, important in certain specific contexts, or actually useful but too charged or taboo for a typical German course to cover—think words like \u0026ldquo;tampon\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hiking pole.\u0026quot;\nI make these booster packs into free Anki decks. There\u0026rsquo;s also a pay-what-you-want premium version of each deck with images, example sentences, plural forms, verb conjugations with highlighted irregular forms, and cloze deletions for each word. The premium versions use a special card format that automatically generates clozes and color-codes based on example sentences (a bit like this one except it works for verbs, too) that can be reused for your own cards as well!\nA new booster pack appears on the first friday of every month.\nCheck out all the Anki decks!\n(pay-what-you-want)",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Using the magic of German grammar, this Anki template automatically color-codes nouns by gender and generates cloze deletions without extra clicks or note types—just enter the word and an example sentence.",
    "body": "One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don\u0026rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.\nClearly easier.\nAnyways, since I did it already you don\u0026rsquo;t have to. I\u0026rsquo;ve made a template that automatically generates cloze deletions based on example sentences in basic card. And to top things off, it automatically color-codes nouns by gender. This is about as painless as making thousands of flashcards by hand gets.\nYou can download my Anki template for German for pay-what-you-want (so probably free) or from Ankiweb. One thing—thanks to German\u0026rsquo;s fun grammar, the auto-cloze feature doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs (yet, see my note at the bottom).\nIf you do test out the format, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you—especially if something went wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m happy and eager to fix any bugs you might find. Happy Anki-ing\nFeatures Automatically-generated cloze deletions generated based on the example sentence Anki basic cards and cloze deletion note types do not play nice. Usually, if you wanted to make a cloze-deletion for an example sentence from one of your basic note types, you\u0026rsquo;d need to either a) make a whole separate note for the cloze deletion or b) manually make \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; cloze deletions, which requires you to create aseparate fields for the complete sentence and the \u0026ldquo;clozed\u0026rdquo; version with your word removed and replaced a blank or other characters.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a drag, especially since cloze-deletions are a great way to learn words in context.\nThis card format makes generating cloze deletions painless—just provide an example sentence containing your word and a script in the template takes care of the rest! These \u0026ldquo;auto-cloze\u0026rdquo; cards aren\u0026rsquo;t true Anki cloze deletions, so they don\u0026rsquo;t require you to use a different note type for your clozes and basic cards. Auto-cloze cards are associated with the same Basic type note as the German-to-translation and translation-to-German cards. Thanks to a bit of grammar magic under the hood, this even works if your word appears in the example in an inflected form.\nNouns color-coded by gender based on article Nouns are automatically recognized by the card template and color-coded according to gender based on their preceeding article (der/die/das). Plural-only nouns are also color-coded—just write p, plural, plural only, or plural-only in the \u0026ldquo;Plural\u0026rdquo; field to indicate that a noun is plural-only. See the how-to for more on plural-only nouns.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like my color choices, you can change the colors of the masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural-only CSS classes in the \u0026ldquo;Styling (shared between cards)\u0026rdquo; in the card template window.\nIntuitive input format In my early days of exploring the wonders of custom Anki formats, I made the mistake of adding so many specific fields to my cards. One format I used for German had more than 8 fields at one point, with separate places to input noun articles, gender, plural forms, verb conjugations, and and and. It basically made the format unusable since I\u0026rsquo;d always make mistakes inputting information into all those fields. A lot of that is because Anki\u0026rsquo;s built in conditional replacement function only works based on field presence/absence. But 8 months later I have a solution to that problem and now the field bloat is finally over.\nI really wanted to keep things intuitive for these cards. The order of fields and expected format for input aligns with how German vocabulary is usually shared in list—i.e. article + noun, plural, translation. And conditional formatting behind the scenes allows the same fields to be re-used for different kinds of words without causing any trouble. No separate fields for nouns and non-nouns or anything like that!\n  Get the template for free! (or pay what you want)\nYou can also download the template from AnkiWeb.\n Example Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick example of how nicely the cards work. Below are a screnshots of what I typed into the input window and the cards generated by the template:\nCard 1: translation to German Card 2: German to translation Card 3: Auto-cloze How-to Hopefully the uses for the fields are intuitive. But there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure that the auto-cloze and color-coding features works correctly. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of what you can put in each field:\nField 1: German\n a noun preceeded by its der/die/das article (die Maus ✅ , Maus ❌) an adjective, conjunction, or any other word that is… NOT a verb. Auto-cloze doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs (see the end note).  Field 2: Plural\n blank if the word in Field 1 is a noun without a plural form or if it is not a noun the plural form of the noun in Field 1, preceeding\u0026quot;die\u0026quot; optional (die Mäuse ✅ , Mäuse ✅) one of p, plural only, plural-only, or plural if the word in Field 1 is a noun without a singular form. This is important, since if this information is omitted your plural-only noun will be color-coded as a feminine noun.  Field 3: Translation: A translation of the German word into a language you already know\nField 4: Example sentence: An example sentence in German containing the word in Field 1. And here\u0026rsquo;s the magic bit: your word can appear in an inflected form, and auto-cloze will still work! (Ich sehe die Maus ✅, Ich sehe die Mäuse ✅ ). Do not treat this field like a cloze field (Ich sehe die Maus ✅, Ich sehe {{c1:die Maus}} ❌ ). The cloze is done automatically by a script in the card template.\nField 5: Image [optional]: An image (or multiple images) that relates to the word in Field 1.\nYou could easily add fields for audio or translations of your example sentences, but I wanted to keep things minimal to avoid field-bloat. If you have requests for new features/fields, just let me know in the comments!\n No verbs yet, but stay tuned Even for regular German verbs, the grammatical rules governing conjugation are much more complicated than for noun declension and adjective agreement. So making an auto-cloze format for verbs was a lot harder than making one for nouns, etc.\nI have a working auto-cloze template for verbs now that can also detect and highlight irregular verbs when the traditional 3-tense conjugation is provided (i.e. denkt, dachte, hat gedacht). However, I want to test it a bit more before making it available since its possible there are bugs I haven\u0026rsquo;t caught. And since getting verbs to work has been a lot of work, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably end up asking for a few bucks in exchange for the auto-cloze-everything-and-automatically-highlight-irregular-verbs card format.\nThanks for reading, and let me know how the template works for you!\n  Get the template for free! (or pay what you want)\nYou can also download the template from AnkiWeb.\n",

    "description": "I tell 'dir' but ask 'dich.' Why? A quick review of the cases taken by verbs describing speech like sagen, fragen, and erzählen",
    "body": "Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole \u0026ldquo;Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache\u0026rdquo; idea. And I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that many of the words that most often initiate a holy-$h!#-what-case-do-I-use death-spiral are the common verbs describing speech: sagen, fragen, and co.\nThe funny thing is, these verbs actually mostly–and I\u0026rsquo;ll\u0026rsquo;get to the mostly bit–behave according to the usual rules dictating case in German. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m getting this wrong all the time because I\u0026rsquo;m over-correcting for the apparent randomness of other common German verbs… or maybe I just never learned these properly. Either way, you can easily avoid making the mistakes I made just by taking a second to peek at the grammar of these common verbs.\nHow not to do it Yesterday I got myself confused about again this during a lesson with my iTalki tutor. We were going over a practice text I had written about a shy girl getting drunk at her friend\u0026rsquo;s birthday party (what a topic) and my tutor pointed out the following mistake in my writing:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben *mich gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nich früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich *sie erzählt habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n In both of the mistakes, I use the wrong case for the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; receiving speech described by the underlined verb. The correct way to write this would be:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben mir gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nicht früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich ihnen erzählt habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s break down how I screwed up.\nThe person being spoken to is usually in the dative case With the vast majority of German verbs for speech, the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; is in the dative case. Most of the time, this is because the verb is following German\u0026rsquo;s usual rules, but there are a few that just need to be memorized.\nOften, the listener is in the dative case because they are the indirect object of the verb. In a sentence, they \u0026ldquo;receive\u0026rdquo; whatever is spoken–an accusative direct object–from the speaker. Verbs that are used this way include sagen (to say), erzhälen (to tell), erklären (to explain), and befehlen (to order).\nThese verbs always take a dative listener—even if the accusative direct object is omitted. For instance:\nIch sagte ihm die Geschichte.\nI told him the sory.\nIch sagte ihm.\nI told him.\nOther common verbs describing speech that also \u0026ldquo;follow the rules\u0026rdquo; take dative listeners because they are used mit, which forces the following noun into the dative. These verbs include reden mit (to converse), sprechen mit (to speak), and mitteilen (to share with).\nSo these words aren\u0026rsquo;t irregular at all when it comes to case. They follow the usual rule stating that the direct object is in the accusative and the indirect object is in the dative.\nBut there are a few sneaky ones that don\u0026rsquo;t (or almost never) take indirect objects and don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;mit,\u0026rdquo; but which still take dative listeners. And some of these are quite common, so they\u0026rsquo;re worth remembering: danken (to thank), gratulieren (to congratulate), verzeihen (to apologize), entgegnen (to counter/retort), and widersprechen (to contradict/refuse). Since these verbs don\u0026rsquo;t take direct objects, it\u0026rsquo;s common to see them followed by a subordinate clause beginning with \u0026ldquo;dass,\u0026rdquo; which explains why the thanking, congratulating, apologizing, etc. occurred. For instance:\nIch danke dir, dass du meinen Blogeintrag gelesen hast.\nThank you for reading my blog post.\nBut fragen and bitten take the accusative Luckily, there aren\u0026rsquo;t very many speech verbs that break pattern and use the accusative case for the person being spoken: among the common verbs, fragen (to ask) and bitten (to request) are the only ones. Even beyond just the context of describing speech, these verbs are pretty unusual. They number among only a handful of German verbs that can take two accusative objects.\nThis is one of those things you should just memorize. But one way I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get myself to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; the accusative here is to think about more aggressive forms of questioning. Just think of how it feels when you\u0026rsquo;re questioned \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; rather than asked \u0026ldquo;of.\u0026rdquo; For a more concrete example, just imagine an interrogation scene from one of those network crime shows that never seems to run out of seasons—lots of questions are asked, most of them pretty \u0026ldquo;accusative.\u0026rdquo;\n And in case you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering why I wrote that practice story about someone getting drunk at a party, the answer is that my awesome tutor had given me just about the most hilarious writing prompt ever:\nThere are a lot of words for \u0026lsquo;drunk\u0026rsquo; in German. Find as many as you can, and then write a story in which the main character is drunk.\nAll those words for \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; are coming up in another post. Cheers! 🍻\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Change card styling and text based on the content of your note fields, not just whether they're empty or not empty",
    "body": "Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.\nOut-of-the-box, Anki supports \u0026ldquo;conditional replacement,\u0026rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty. This is how it works:\nShown always {{#Field}} Shown only if Field is not empty {{/Field}} {{^Field}} Shown only if Field is empty {{/Field}} Shown always That\u0026rsquo;s useful, but it has limitations.\nIf I wanted to use conditional replacement to color-code my German cards by gender, I would have needed to create different fields for the masculine, feminine, and neuter1 definite articles and be careful to only fill in one of those 3 fields as I made my cards. And that\u0026rsquo;s maybe even more of a pain in the butt than going through and color-coding everything by hand.\nLuckily, there\u0026rsquo;s a way to pull off content-based conditional formatting even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t baked into Anki. The solution involves a bit of CSS and Javascript, but trust me, it\u0026rsquo;s not too painful (definitely less painful than hand-formatting everything) and you can mostly copy-and-paste the templates below.\nCredit where credit is due: I didn\u0026rsquo;t come up with this myself. Look hard enough on Anki forums and you\u0026rsquo;ll find the answer (I found it here). But I wanted to save other code-illiterates the hours it took me to figure out how to make this work by going into a bit more detail and providing a concrete example.\nChanging card style and displaying different text based on field content The way this works is by using Javascript to change the CSS styling of some part of your card based on field content. You can also change what text gets displayed based on field contents as well. This card template shows how to do both:\nCard Template (front and/or back):\nNormal content \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_style'\u0026gt; Conditionally styled content \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_text'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional style--\u0026gt;\tif ('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementByID('conditional_style').classList.add('condition') }; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; if('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementById('conditional_text').innerHTML = 'conditional text' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card{ /* card style */ } .condition{ /* condition1 style */ } Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\nThe condition this card checks for is whether the text in field \u0026ldquo;Field\u0026rdquo; (creative name, right?) is exactly the word \u0026ldquo;condition.\u0026rdquo; If the condition is met, the conditional style span is styled by the CSS class condition (defined in the Styling box) and the conditional_text span is replaced by \u0026ldquo;conditional text.\u0026rdquo; If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met, then everything is styled by the card CSS class and no conditional text is shown.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re confused about how the JavaScript between the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags works, check out this page on conditionals in JavaScript and these on finding elements by their id, changing their CSS class, and replacing their internal HTML. The nice thing is that once you get how this works, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to adapt the basic idea to do whatever specific task you might have in mind. For instance, it\u0026rsquo;d be easy to condition your cards on other true-false conditions, like whether a field includes a certain word (rather than precisely equalling it).\nYou can also embed conditional text within a conditionally styled span. Which is exactly how my German noun flashcards work.\nExample: color-colding German articles by gender That\u0026rsquo;s all pretty abstract, so instead of ending there I wanted to quickly go through how my German flashcards work. I\u0026rsquo;ve only shown the template for the front of the German-to-English card since the code works the same wherever you paste it and this post is getting long enough already. You can download my deck from Ankiweb if you want to take a look at the card templates more closely (but it\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress and the templates are messier than the cleaned-up version I show here. You\u0026rsquo;ve been warned!).\nFields2: German, Gender, Plural, English, Example, Images\nIn the Gender field, I use \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; for masculine, \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; for feminine, and \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; for neuter nouns. I also sometimes use \u0026ldquo;p,\u0026rdquo; which stands for \u0026ldquo;plural-only\u0026rdquo; to distinguish feminine from plural nouns when there\u0026rsquo;s no singular form.\nCard Front:\n\u0026lt;big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{German}} \u0026lt;/big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;small\u0026gt;{{Plural}}\u0026lt;/small\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Example}} \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Images}} \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;m\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('m') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML= 'der' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('f') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('n') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'das' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;p\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('p') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card { font-family: arial; font-size: 40px; text-align: center; color: black; background-color: white; } .m { color: royalblue; } .f { color: palevioletred; } .n{ color: goldenrod } .p{ color: black } The result? Some nicely color-coded cards that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to color-code myself. And the best part is that this will automatically work on any new cards of this note type as well, which is great for me since I tend to mass-import cards from spreadsheets of vocabulary.\nFor anyone wondering, yes those are my cats. Their names are Hubble and Chandra. The dog (Jule) is my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s.\nHappy flashcarding!\n  I\u0026rsquo;d also need a field for plural nouns. Some German nouns only ever take the plural definite article \u0026ldquo;die,\u0026rdquo; which is identical in the nominative case to the feminine article. I color-code plural nouns differently as well, and this overlap of \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; is one of the main reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t conditionally format on an article field containing one of \u0026ldquo;der\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;das\u0026rdquo; but rather on a gender/plural field containing one of \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo;. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n These aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly the names of the fields I use, since I store more than one definition for each word on my cards. I simplified things for clarity. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ",

    "description": "Any language-learning tool that can compete against social media and mobile games for our attention is worth giving a shot",
    "body": "Duolingo gets a lot of flack in some corners of the language-learning internet, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom… This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nHow to use Duolingo effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet–you get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking Süddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired my Duolingo habit.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo—if you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\n Owl trophy image from https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/8613388/I-Have-Conquered-My-German-Treewith, edited by me\n",

    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn\u0026rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have tried, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.\nDespite having studied the language for 2 years, I could barely understand him at the beginning. But with time, I learned to learned to map his upper-Austrian dialect onto my patchy foreigner\u0026rsquo;s Hochdeutsch. That was the easy part. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning to stop worrying about making mistakes—and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized how important it is that I do.\nScrewing up is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe even necessary. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing it when it comes to learning. I can almost feel my brain tying neurons together in a frenzy of embarrased desparation every time I\u0026rsquo;m corrected.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the idea behind \u0026ldquo;Fehler Files,\u0026rdquo; a little series I\u0026rsquo;m kicking off in this post. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing real ways I\u0026rsquo;ve screwed up speaking German in short posts so you can experience that feeling embarrased desparation vicariously (though I won\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s a substitute for the real deal. Go find your own person to point out all your flaws—grammatical and otherwise—for you, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing better). It will hopefully add up to something like a collection of bite-sized grammar reviews of topics that are both tricky and common enough to give a B1/B2-level speaker trouble.\nTo start things off, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how I\u0026rsquo;ve butchered the German dative plural.\nIch lerne Deutsch seit zwei Jahr…e…en. And I still can\u0026rsquo;t remember the dative plural One of the mistakes I notice myself getting corrected on most frequently is missing ns on my dative plurals. Take this example from a moment when I embarrrased myself trying to compensate for my monoglualism by pointing out how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come with German in two years…\n \u0026ldquo;Ich bringe mir seit nur zwei Jahre Deutch bei und habe bereits das Niveau B2 erre–\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Was?\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en, nicht Jahr-e. Du bringst dir seit zwei Jahren Deutch bei.\u0026quot;\n That sneaky \u0026ldquo;-n\u0026rdquo; marks the dative plural, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I often forget it when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about lengths of time. I suspect that this is because many of the German prepositions used to talk about time take the dative case, and we often talk about time in terms of plural units (seconds, days, months, years, etc.).\nSo, here\u0026rsquo;s a reminder—to you and to me—that the dative plural exists! And it does show up in a lot of contexts (especially to indicate the indirect object of verbs and with certain prepositions), so it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember.\nThe dative plural Making the dative plural is simple: Add an \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; to the end of the nominative plural. If the word ends in -n (i.e. Gärten) already, or ends in -s (i.e. Autos), don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. Remembering not to add the -n to plurals ending in -s isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard, because \u0026ldquo;Autosn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Opasn\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right.\n   nom. Singular Nom. Plural Dat. Plural     der Mann die Männer den Männern   das Jahr die Jahre den Jahren   die Maus die Mäuse den Mäusen   die Frau die Frauen den Frauen (no change)    As a reminder, the definite for the dative plural is den. The indefinite plural takes no article (called the \u0026ldquo;null article\u0026rdquo;). And the dative plural is very consistent. All the adjectives and articles that come a dative plural noun also end in \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;.\nDer Lehrer hilft den jungen Kindern. The teacher helps the young children.\nDie Jägerin versteckt sich zwischen den grünen Bäumen. The huntress is hiding between the green trees.\nEs ist den kleinen Mädchen kalt.\nThe little girls are cold.\nQuick reminder: when to use the dative Flip open any German grammar book and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the main uses of the dative case are:\n indicating indirect objects of verbs (ex. Ich gebe den Pferden einen Apfel) indicating who is affected by a verb\u0026rsquo;s action (ex. Sie schrieb ihnen einen Brief) following many prepositions (ex. zu, mit, seit, nach, etc.)  There are also some more specific uses that show up regularly but that I don\u0026rsquo;t see mentioned so often outside of hardcore grammar books:\n indicating possession of body parts, articles of clothing, prized possessions, and close relatives (ex. Den Waisenkindern sind gerade die Eltern gestorben) with adjectives, especially adjectives with zu or genug (ex. Diese Uhren sind den Kunden zu teuer.)  I won\u0026rsquo;t go into these here now, since I plan on coming back to the dative case later and breaking each of these down in more detail in regular posts. Anyhow, let me know what you think in the comments, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget your dative plurals!\n",
