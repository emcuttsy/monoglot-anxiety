    "body": "There are lots of language learning strategies and programs out there for beginners, and I think that most of them probably work—if only because they involve spending lots of time with your new language. But I\u0026rsquo;m lazy. And maybe you are, too. So if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to learn a new language with no real plan and close to 0 focused study, you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place. Welcome to my silly experiment.\nFor the next 4 months, I\u0026rsquo;ll be learning Italian to test the limits of low-effort language learning—no courses, no textbooks, (almost) no budget for resources, no Anki, and absolutely no organized programs or strategies.\nBasically, I want to know if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to build a foundation in a completely new language armed only with Duolingo, Netflix, and dreams.\nCan you teach yourself a language without lots of time to study? I think the answer is yes, and that\u0026rsquo;s because I did it before with German.\nI got from \u0026ldquo;Hallo\u0026rdquo; to about B1 in the thick of a depression, at time when I didn\u0026rsquo;t do much other than sit on the floor and mope while watching Dark over and over. I definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t take a class or make vocabulary lists or otherwise stick to any kind of plan to devote focused hours to language-learning.\nThe tricky thing is, I can\u0026rsquo;t really remember what I did do. The way I remember it, it\u0026rsquo;s as if one day I couldn\u0026rsquo;t speak German at all and then one day I was watching ZDF Magazin Royal and holding hour-long conversations. But that\u0026rsquo;s almost certainly not how it actually played out. What was I doing back then that worked?\nThe point of this experiment is to figure out if I\u0026rsquo;m right in suspecting that the answer is \u0026ldquo;not much, actually.\u0026rdquo; My bet is that Duolingo, podcasts, and lots of Italian media (plus a spoonful of that language-learning secret sauce: genuine interest in the cultures associated with the target language) I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get to somewhere around A2, at least for comprehension, by the new year.\nBut of course, like any good scientist*, I\u0026rsquo;m prepared to be proven wrong.\nLazy Italian self-study experimental design Here\u0026rsquo;s how this will work: At the beginning of each month, I\u0026rsquo;ll write a post summing up my progress and outlining a broad-strokes \u0026ldquo;strategy\u0026rdquo; for the next month\u0026rsquo;s language-learning. I\u0026rsquo;ll also point out any ways my strategy went off the tracks outlined in the previous month\u0026rsquo;s post.\nThroughout the experiment, I\u0026rsquo;ll be following a set of rules intended to keep things lazy (see below). I\u0026rsquo;m also not allowed to spend money on language-learning for the most part.\nTo track my progress, I\u0026rsquo;ll report the most complicated piece of Italian media I could understand reasonably well (i.e., well enough to enjoy without translations). And at the end of the experiment, I\u0026rsquo;ll take an A2 practice test.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also post short updates and stream-of-consciousness mini posts related to learning Italian on my Buy Me A Coffee page. So if you want to follow along, head over there. In general, that\u0026rsquo;s the best place to keep up with what I\u0026rsquo;m up to.\nNote: As an actual scientist, I\u0026rsquo;m obligated to inform you that this is horrible experimental design. But good experimental design is boring and hard, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to settle for well-documented anectodtal evidence.\nThe Lazy Italian Self-Study Experiment Rules  No traditional resources: No textbooks, grammar books, or traditional courses allowed No sit-down study time: Quickly looking up grammar questions is ok, but there will be no workbook pages, no vocab drills, and definitely no reading textbooks. Meeting with tutors is ok. No Anki: This is about being lazy, not making 1000 flashcards. Limited, cheap tutors: I can meet with an online tutor 1/wk for an hour, but the tutor must cost below $20/hr and I can only start meeting with a tutor after I can understand most of what I hear on kids TV. Limited Duolingo: Since Duolingo will be my primary mode of exposure to new vocabulary and grammar, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to let myself burn through it and ruin the \u0026ldquo;laziness\u0026rdquo; experiment. So I\u0026rsquo;ll limit myself to a maximum of 200 experience per day (which I almost certainly won\u0026rsquo;t reach most days). Only free resources: The rule says it all. Exception for tutors under the $20/hr limit.    The initial strategy While my beginner days as a German learner are a bit of a blur, I do know some things about my early \u0026ldquo;strategy,\u0026rdquo; if it can be called that.\nI that know I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any formal classes. I know that I did use lots of Duolingo, and that I watched a lot of TV and listened to a lot of German music. I also know that the only other resources I used at first were Olly Richard and Alex Rawling\u0026rsquo;s Short Stories in German and the free versions of the podcasts Coffee Break German and News in Slow German.\nSo, drawing on that \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; and consdidering the challenge rules, here\u0026rsquo;s my strategy for month 1:\n Use Duolingo every day for exposure to new vocabulary and grammar. I\u0026rsquo;ll mainly be doing this during in-between moments like while resting between attempts at the bouldering gym or sitting on the subway. Binging is allowed, but only up to 200 xp per day (see above). My daily goal is 50 xp. Watch a kids show I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with in Italian with Italian subtitles every night—even if I don\u0026rsquo;t understand much. I\u0026rsquo;m starting with The Dragon Prince on Netflix, which I\u0026rsquo;ve watched in English and German already. This is how I\u0026rsquo;ll learn to map spelling to sounds, get an ear for pronunciation, and hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll somehow feed the unknowable language machine in my brain and get it to start understanding Italian. I tend to repeat after sentences I hear on TV, too. This sounds silly (especially the not understanding much bit), but worked for me with German. Don\u0026rsquo;t meet with tutors yet. I want to be able to speak a little before I spend money on a tutor. Listen to Coffee Break Italian while doing chores, commuting, or other boring tasks that require hands. I like this series a lot for its grammar explanations and as a way to train my ear. I do find the content boring and travel-focused, like most beginner stuff. But it\u0026rsquo;s so easy to access that the low activation energy barrier overwhelms my distaste for resources like this. Start falling in love with Italian stuff. This is a biggie for me. It means finding Italian music I like, reading about the canon of Italian literature, classical music, art, food, and culture there is for me to discover if I get better, crawling around on Italian subreddits, and reading about Italy. I need to have a reason to care. Find and listen to as much Italian music as possible. Sometimes you just don\u0026rsquo;t want to listen to Coffee Break Italian. Luckily, I\u0026rsquo;m very excited to discover Italo-disco\u0026hellip;  This strategy will almost certainly change as I learn more Italian. That\u0026rsquo;s part of the experiment, too. In my monthly updates, I\u0026rsquo;ll also epxlain the changes I plan to make to my langauge strategy (and any changes I made on the fly) for the next month.\nDefine beginner While I have never studied Italian, I do have a few advantages going in that might make it a bit disingenous to call myself a complete beginner.\nFor one, this isn\u0026rsquo;t my first rodeo. Learning languages is a skill in itself (a metaskill?) and I\u0026rsquo;ve succesfully taught myself a language before. German isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly Italian\u0026rsquo;s twin brother, but they\u0026rsquo;re both Indo-European languages and I anticipate that studying German\u0026rsquo;s arguably more complex grammar might give me a leg up when it comes to intuiting the rules of Italian.\nSecond, I took Spanish classes in a past life. Granted, that past life was high school and high school was almost 10 years ago now (yikes), but it\u0026rsquo;s still worth mentioning since I was, apparently, reasonably good at Spanish. Italian and Spanish are very similar languages and my exposure to Spanish will almost certainly make things a tad easier. But while I might have been good enough to pass the IB higher level spanish exam with a rather good score, I was apparently not good enough to remember any Spanish at all 10 years later. My German is better after 2 years of chaotic self-study than my Spanish ever was even after 4 years of high school classes.\nHow to follow the experiment New posts related to the challenge will appear here at the beginning of each month. And as mentioned above, anyone interested in following along as I learn Italian should head over to my Buy Me a Coffee page. I\u0026rsquo;m also trying (god it\u0026rsquo;s hard) to be a human on Twitter and have exhumed the corpse of my old #langtwt account so you can follow and say hi @monoglotanxiety.\nYou can also leave a comment or, as always, email me at hello@monoglotanxiety.com.\nCiao for now!\n *I actually am a scientist, it\u0026rsquo;s my day job. This is my night not-job.\n",

    "title": "How to  make better language flashcards by combining writing practice with spaced repetition",
    "date": "",
    "description": "Write, get your writing corrected by native speakers, and turn your mistakes into flashcards",
    "body": "Writing is one of my favorite ways to actively study German. It is great for vocabulary building and grammar practice, and in the absence of speaking opportunities, it is the only way to get practice with production skills. But beyond simply being a great way to practice on its own, writing is a key component of how I use flashcards and spaced repetition to learn German. In this post, I break down how to use writing practice to get more out of spaced repetition systems like Anki.\nTLDR: Combine Anki or another SRS with writing practice for better flashcards By integrating an SRS into your writing practice, you can learn and remember the grammar, vocabulary, etc. that you struggle with most and avoid wasting time studying things you already know. Simply write in your target language, make mistakes while writing, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards to use with an SRS like Anki. If you use Anki, a simple and fast way to make \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is to make cloze deletions based on the corrected sentence.\n  Spaced repetition is a well-studied learning method, and a large body of evidence backs up the claims of the many language bloggers and internet polyglots who tout its benefits. Most modern language learning tools are based on a spaced repetition system (SRS) under the hood, so if you\u0026rsquo;re using Duolingo or Memrise study a language, you\u0026rsquo;ve already have gotten a taste of what spaced repetition is about.\nI use Anki for all of my language flashcards because it is free and very flexible—it works just as well for med students cramming for the MCAT as it does for me as a German learner. This flexibility extends to templating and allows for fun things like automatic color-coding if you hate yourself enough to write out the JavaScript. Check out my Anki templates and decks if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. They\u0026rsquo;re all free.\nWhen used well, an SRS like Anki can be incredibly helpful because it helps you to move concepts from short-term into long-term memory very efficiently, which is exactly what serious language learners need. But using an SRS doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can abandon other study methods. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the most success using Anki when I combine it with other study methods—especially writing.\nThree rules for a healthy flashcard diet The tricky thing about using an SRS like Anki is that it needs to be fed properly. If you use your SRS consistently, you\u0026rsquo;ll remember pretty much everything in your decks. This open-endedness makes SRSs flexible enough to help you learn everything from German verb forms to the bones of the hand, but comes with a downside: Anki doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about what you learn, it just cares that you learn. If you study an unhelpful deck, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn unhelpful things.\nWhat a healthy flashcard diet looks like will be different depending on your needs. But regardless what you\u0026rsquo;re learning, good flashcards will tend to adhere to two basic principles: novelty and relevance.\n Novelty: Flashcards should teach us something we don\u0026rsquo;t already know well Relevance: Flashcards should teach us something useful Simplicity: Flashcards should ask clear \u0026ldquo;questions\u0026rdquo; with straightforward answers (See: minimum information principle)  Adhering to novelty, relevance, and simplicity will help you get more out of your SRS whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner learning your first words or a veteran of the B2-plateau like me who needs to focus more on grammar, usage, and more obscure vocab. Incidentally, you can apply these \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; just as well to topics other than language. So go memorize your amino acids or whatever else you\u0026rsquo;re procrastinating on by reading this post.\nBut how to make sure your deck is novel, relevant, and simple?\nI know that there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a split among the langosphere giants when it comes to whether it\u0026rsquo;s best to make your own flashcards or use pre-made decks to save time. And then of course there\u0026rsquo;s the anti-flashcard crowd, but I don\u0026rsquo;t negotiate with terrorists so I won\u0026rsquo;t address any of their points here. I\u0026rsquo;m no polyglot, but my unqualified opinion tends to fall on the make-your-own-flashcards side of the debate, if only for one reason:\nMaking your own flashcards is a good way to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re learning novel and relevant cards.\nThere are some great ready-made flashcard decks out there that, depending on your needs, might already check all three boxes for you. This is especially true for beginners, who often need to learn the same set of core vocabulary when they\u0026rsquo;re just starting out. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve made a bit of progress, the relevance and novelty of ready-made decks falls off fast unless you have a good way of filtering through them. It is very easy to waste time \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; things you either don\u0026rsquo;t need or already know when using decks made by others.\nThis is why making your own flashcards can be so helpful. When you make a deck yourself, you have more control over your flashcard diet.\nThe chicken-and-egg problem of making good flashcards Unfortunately, making good flashcards presents something of a chicken-and-egg problem. Simplicity is usually pretty easy to recognize in cards. If you can\u0026rsquo;t tell what a flashcard is asking you or the answer is complicated enough that you keep getting parts of it right and parts of it wrong, then the card isn\u0026rsquo;t simple enough. But what about novelty and relevance?\nNovel, relevant cards teach us things that we need to learn but don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about something, how can you know whether it is relevant or not? And worse, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know that a certain word or grammar concept exists—even if it might be very relevant to you—how can you know to put it on a flashcard?\nLanguage teachers and courses exist to address these problems. Their job is quite literally to decide what novel information is most relevant for learners at various stages.\nBut language teachers and courses can be expensive or inaccessible. And often, the kind of de-facto \u0026ldquo;relevance\u0026rdquo; imposed by quizzes and sets of vocabulary and grammar topics grouped by chapter/module doesn\u0026rsquo;t align well with real relevance—you could easily end up learning the names of 15 family members you don\u0026rsquo;t have instead of picking up a grammar concept that could move you closer to your specific language goals.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that there\u0026rsquo;s no place for teachers or textbooks iny our learning plan. There probably is a place for them. Their place just isn\u0026rsquo;t dictating 100% of the contents of your flashcard deck.\nWrite in your target language and turn your mistakes into flashcards It would be absurd to sit down and attempt to plan out the content for your cards in advance. Not only would you risk getting caught up in the chicken-and-egg problem, but you\u0026rsquo;d probably also waste a ton of time. Flashcards are just one tool for language learning and, ideally, making them shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a chore that siphons time away from language learning.\nNo, instead of playing teacher and attempting to design a custom curriculum for yourself, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to simply let your flashcards emerge organically as you use your target language. And the best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this is to write.\nWrite, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards.\nWriting preserves our mistakes clearly in text. When we set down a book or finish a show in our target language, we aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a printed-out list of words and phrases that we didn\u0026rsquo;t understand while reading or watching. And while speaking in a new language is notoriously intimidating, it is also more forgiving than writing: when we speak, our mistakes disappear as soon as we stop speaking. But whatever we write has the potential to stick around—mistakes and all—for as long as the paper it was written on or file it was saved in exists.\nThis can make writing intimidating, but it also makes it incredibly useful. Because writing records our mistakes, we can use writing practice as a kind of compass that points towards the grammar and vocabulary you need to learn or review and allows you to avoid wasting time wandering through topics you already understand well.\nCombining writing with an SRS allows your flashcards to emerge organically. Your decks will grow with you, naturally reflecting the way you use your target language and the topics you need the most help learning. If you made a mistake on something, odds are that you don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand it yet. Novelty, check. And the fact that you tried to use it at all indicates that it would have been useful for you to know better. Relevance, check.\nTip: Use cloze deletion to quickly turn mistakes into flashcards The most helpful format that I\u0026rsquo;ve found for \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is also one of the easiest to make: cloze deletions.\nCloze deletions are essentially fill-in-the-blank questions. The front of a card has a sentence or other text with some element(s) removed and replaced with a placeholder […]. The back of the card is the whole sentence without deletions.\n  Getting your writing corrected by native speakers is easy these days. Here are a few different places to look for corrections. Most are free!\n LangCorrect (free). Correction exchange, usually fast feedback. My go-to. Language subreddits (free). I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German. There are writing-specific subs for some languages as well, like r/WriteStreakGerman. Twitter (free). Certain Twitter communities are full of language learners that are happy to help with requests. Check out #langtwt to find people interested in language who speak your target language. iTalki tutors (cheap). Many will proofread outside of lesson time for a low price per page, just ask. Teachers (only if you\u0026rsquo;re in a course already). If you\u0026rsquo;re taking a class, just use your corrected writing assignments to make flashcards.  When it comes to actually making cards out of mistakes, I usually use cloze deletions. Thes are a sort of fill-in-the-blank style flashcard that is very quick to make. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a mistake card I made recently based on corrections from LangCorrect:\nNote that I clozed both adjective endings here. If I had only clozed one, the card would ask a different \u0026ldquo;question\u0026rdquo; than it does currently. The mistake I originally made was knowing whether Wort was neuter or masculine, not whether the adjective endings of gut and deutsch were the same. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give myself too much of a hint by leaving the -es ending on one of the two adjectives, I clozed both endings.\nI mention this just as an example of how you might think about creating your own cards. Be sure to test the mistake you actually made, not a mistake you didn\u0026rsquo;t (even if the card would be a tad simpler that way).\nExample: How I combine writing practice with Anki to make better German flashcards In case you\u0026rsquo;re interested in seeing a concrete implementation of this idea, here\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated Anki into my writing practice:\n Each day, I try (often unsuccessfully) to set aside 30 minutes to write in German. I usually respond to a prompt I find online, or just complain about something that upset me recently. Then I submit my writing to LangCorrect for corrections by native speakers. I usually correct 1-2 submissions by English learners while I\u0026rsquo;m at it to give back and improve the chances that my writing is corrected quickly. Sometimes, I meet with a German tutor on iTalki during the week and we correct a written homework assignment, so I get writing corrections that way as well. Once I get corrections back, I go through them and turn each correction into a flashcard. This is as simple as copy-pasting the corrected sentence into an Anki cloze card and clozing the bits I screwed up. If necessary, I add a hint or translation to the card, but usually the sentence provides enough context on its own.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s so simple that I wonder now how I managed to write this much about it. That\u0026rsquo;s blogging for you.\n",

But I\u0026rsquo;ve been cooking more with my boyfriend, and when he bothers to use a recipe all it always ends up as rapid-fire German sputtering even if it started out a written recipe. Clearly it was time to get to work on a flashcard deck of German cooking verbs.\nThis deck is the result: 38 verbs you\u0026rsquo;ll need in the kitchen, complete with example sentences, images, audio, color-coding, and cloze deletions.

The host shares helpful recipes, but rarely measures anything except in pinches, spoonfuls, and bunches and encourages plenty of experimentation with \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; variants on classic recipes. He is also clearly more commited to making something tasty and easy than he is to recipe purity, and often shares tricks for avoiding the hard to aquire or expensive ingredients in dishes like ramen without sacrificing flavor.\nThis one on goulash is full of illegality.

These 10 channels are a great resource for German learners or anyone else looking for awesome science videos in German.\nMany of these channels are supported by German public broadcasters like ZDF, so you can look forward to plenty of ad-free immersion.\nWith that, I hope you nerds enjoy!!\n1. Mailab One of the most famous German-language YouTube channels, Mailab was my gateway drug for German science YouTube. The host, Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim, earned her PhD in chemistry before becoming a full-time science communicator and YouTuber. Her videos cover a wide range of scientific topics relevant to daily life, and she often debunks popular science myths. As a scientist myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been amazed by how clearly Mai communicates complex ideas—not just about science, but about the scientific process as well—without sacrificing accuracy.\nHer video on why and how scientists make mistakes and what that really means the best treatment of this issue tjat I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to find on YouTube—in German or English—to date.\n2. Dinge Erklärt (Kurzgesagt) You might already be familiar with the insanely popular (14+ million subscriber) science and philosophy channel Kurzgesagt, but did you realize that there\u0026rsquo;s a German-language Kurzgesagt channel, too? In fact, the studio behind Kurzgesagt is based in Munich, so you might even consider the German-language channel the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; Kurzgesagt (even though it was started 2 years later and has about 8% of the subscribers).\nMany videos are simply German versions of those on the English channel, but there are a few that are exclusive to one language or the other. This video on homeopathy isn\u0026rsquo;t available in English, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great look at a pretty hot-button issue in Germany.\n3. Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co Terra X, a brand associated with the German public broadcaster ZDF, is essentially the German version of the Discovery Channel…if the Discovery Channel was still producing educational documentaries instead of overproduced docu-series about dudes with weird or dangerous jobs. There are 3 Terra X channels on YouTube, my favorite being Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co.\nLesch\u0026amp;Co is one of the two science-focused arms of the Terra X channel trio, with content made with a more grown-up audience in mind than counterpart Terra X plus. Most of the videos are about physics and astronomy, perhaps because the main host, Harald Lesch, is a walking, talking stereotype of a physicist—sweatervests and all. It\u0026rsquo;s a great channel with interesting videos and a dynamic team of co-hosts including Mai Nguyen-Kim of Mailab.\nFor the classic Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co astrophysics-y experience, check out the playlist \u0026ldquo;Das Weltall erklärt.\u0026quot;\nWant more German YouTube channels and other media? If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more German YouTube channels, I write a little newsletter that offers up a new recommendaiton for German YouTube channels, movies, TV, music, podcasts, books, and more each week. It\u0026rsquo;s completely free. And because I hate spam as much as you do, here\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you\u0026rsquo;ll receive:\n 1 weekly recommendation for German media (every Friday) 1 monthly newsletter summing up what\u0026rsquo;s new with the blog (last Sunday of the month)  That\u0026rsquo;s it. You can also check out the archives to see all of the past recommendations without signing up.\nWant in?\nEnter your email    4. Terra X plus Like sister channel Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co, Terra X plus is a science channel from ZDF. The content is intended for school kids and teens, so this channel might be a better choice than Lesch\u0026amp;Co you\u0026rsquo;re just starting to learn German.\nUnlike a lot of science channels, this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t just stick to astrophysics. There\u0026rsquo;s biology, too, like this video on how trees communicate with one another.\n5. Quarks A well-known German science and technology show, but Quarks has kept up with the 21st century trends by making a YouTube channel as well. If you like any of the TerraX channels, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably enjoy Quarks as well. The channel has tons of videos on scientific topics (especially those relevant to everyday life, society and politics) and there are plenty of interesting science history and natural history videos as well.\nI really enjoyed what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far of the \u0026ldquo;Die Geschichte von…\u0026rdquo; series, which isn\u0026rsquo;t always about science but is exactly the kind of thing I remember loving to watch on the Discovery Channel as a kid.\n6. BYTEthinks For the more technically inclined, BYTEthinks is a YouTube channel full of short, byte-sized (haha) videos on technology and science. The video style is fun, mostly consisting of stick-figure style animations and virtual chalkboard diagrams that help clarify complex topics. The channel definitely has a focus on computer science.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? Try BYTEthinks' video on artificial intelligence.\n7. Psychologeek Psychology, like many social sciences, often falls victim to twisted interpretation that can lead to persistent, wrong, and sometimes harmful scientific myths. Psychologeek host and psychologist Pia Kabitzsch does a great job breaking down the real science behind popular psychology topics for a wide audience and, when necessary, debunking those pesky myths.\nI loved her video on the ever-popular Myers-Briggs personality types. Decide for yourself whether to file those under psychology fact or potentially harmful myth.\n8. Explainity Explainity isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a science channel–it\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;education project\u0026rdquo; with videos on pretty much anyting complicated enough to require a bit of explaining. The hand-drawn video style is super engaging, and there are plenty of videos on natural science and medicine in addition to Explanity\u0026rsquo;s fantastic content on German politics and society.\nThe video on photosynthesis does a great job walknig through not only the science involved, but also the history behind how photosynthesis was descovered.\n9. AllesPhysik AllesPhysik is a straightforward physics and astronomy YouTube channel. If you liked Cosmos, you might like this: the channel\u0026rsquo;s creator, Thomas, has made almost 20 videos so far on the solar system, space exploration, and the cosmology. Videos are usually short, no more than 10 minutes, so you can definitely squeeze in a bit of German practice with AllesPhysik even if you\u0026rsquo;re pressed for time.\nAllesPhysik\u0026rsquo;s latest video was on discovering habitable exoplants.\n10. Terra X Rounding out the Terra X trio and this list of German science YouTube channels is Terra X (no \u0026ldquo;plus,\u0026rdquo; no \u0026ldquo;Lesch\u0026amp;Co\u0026rdquo;) . It comes in last of the three since it has more of a historical than scientific bent, but there are plenty of good cosmology, earth history, and archaeology videos on the channel as well.\nThe playlist on spaceflight is a good place to look for science videos on this channel.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re already a fan of some of these channels—one even has a popular English counterpart. Or, maybe I missed oned you would have included. Are there any other subjects you\u0026rsquo;d like me to list out some great German YouTube channels about? Do you just want to shame me for writing a listicle? Whatever the case, just drop a comment below if you want to say something. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just to ring the shame bell).\n",

    "body": "When we learn a new language, we focus on learning the words we actually need to communicate. But eventually, you might want to be able to get across points like \u0026ldquo;pine tree\u0026rdquo; without having to say things like \u0026ldquo;der Baum, der Nadeln statt Blätter hat.\u0026rdquo;\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s booster pack is a deck full of eventually words involving trees—both the German names for specific types of trees and the German words for parts of trees like roots and branches.\nBecause, sure, you can get by with just \u0026ldquo;Baum\u0026rdquo;. But where\u0026rsquo;s the fun in that?\nNote: Anki decks now have German audio for words and example sentences Starting with this booster pack, all Anki decks will have German audio going forward. I\u0026rsquo;m currently working to create audio for the last two booster packs as well, and will update my flashcard template to incorperate space for audio files soon.\nIf you use Duolingo, you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize the voice. I use Amazon Polly for text-to-speech, which is the service that powers Duolingo.\n  You can download the deck for free or pay-what-you-want. The deck includes images and example sentences for every word, plays German audio for all words and example sentences, and is based on a reusable flashcard template that automatically color-codes nouns by gender, highlights irregular verbs, and creates cloze deletions from example sentences without an extra click.\n  Get the deck\n The vocabulary list is provided below if you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to make your own cards.\nA funny song to help you learn German names for trees: \u0026ldquo;Das Sägewerk Bad Segeberg\u0026rdquo; by the Wise Guys The idea for this week\u0026rsquo;s deck came from a goofy German song about a sawmill. \u0026ldquo;Das Sägewerk Bad Segeberg\u0026rdquo; by the Wise Guys packs about as many different trees into the lyrics as possibe for a 2:45 minute-long song. After my tutor shared the song with me a few weeks ago, I just had to make a deck about trees.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made sure to include every type of tree mentioned in \u0026ldquo;Das Sägewerk Bad Segeberg\u0026rdquo; in the deck. So after you\u0026rsquo;ve studied up a bit, give the song a listen—you should recognize a lot of new words.\nQuick note: there isn\u0026rsquo;t actually a sawmill in the real German town of Bad Segeberg.

    "title": "The best German Anki template. Probably. Automatic color-coding and cloze deletions",
    "date": "",
    "description": "This free template automatically color-codes nouns based on gender, highlights irregular verbs, and even generates cloze deletions based on example sentences without an extra click. Supports images and audio.",
    "body": "After almost a year of experimentation, I\u0026rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as \u0026ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll say that this is \u0026ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.\u0026rdquo; You can download it for free.\nEmphasis on probably.\nThis template automatically generates cloze-deletions from example sentences, determines the gender of nouns and color-codes accordingly, and recognizes and highlights irregular verbs. It supports images and audio for both German words and example sentences, and has an inutitive input format that uses the same fields for all parts of speech—no special fields for nouns, verbs, etc. that are left blank all the time.\nI released a similar template before, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs. This template works for all German words, and even has some extra features for verbs.\nThe Anki template with example cards is free Pay-what-you-want if you like, but otherwise just enjoy.\n  Get the free deck  If you notice any issues with the template or have comments, questions, ideas for improvements, or otherwise want to get in touch, please email me at hello@monoglotanxiety.com.\nAbout the template The point of this German Anki template is to make it easier to make well-formatted German flashcards that help you learn better. That means making cloze deletions fast and easy, using an intuitive field setup for quick input, and color-coding nouns and verbs to help you notice and remember the important grammatical properties of these words.\nFeatures  Nouns automatically color-coded by gender. The template determines a noun\u0026rsquo;s gender automatically from its definite article (der, die, or das) and color-codes accordingly. Irregular verb forms automatically highlighted. The template highlights irregular verbs by predicting a set of theoretial \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; conjugations and marking any that don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Cloze deletions automatically generated from example sentences. My template uses a little script to predict different forms a word might appear in, search for these forms in the example sentence, and generate a faux cloze deletion by removing the correct word and replacing it with […]. This results in cards that look exactly like traditional clozes but doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any extra clicks or additional note types. Intuitive input with flexible fields that work for nouns, verbs, and everything else. The same set of fields work for every word, regardless of whether it is a verb, noun, or something else. Field order mirrors the typical order in which words and their variants (i.e. plurals, conjugations) are provided in vocabulary lists. Support for images and audio. Cards work without images and audio, but media is added easily. Separate audio for words and example sentences is supported.  Cards  Translation-to-German: Front - translation, image. Back - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, audio of german word + front   German-to-Translation: Front - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, image, audio of German word. Back - translation + front   Auto-close: Front - auto-cloze, translation, image. Back - auto-cloze answer, audio of example sentence, German word, info (plural/conjugation) + front  I hope this card format makes at least one aspect of your German study routine a bit easier. Flashcards are a super helpful tool, but time spent messing with formatting and making extra cloze deletion cards takes up time that could be better spent actually learning German.\n How-to guide There are example cards in the deck package that demonstrate how to use the template for nouns (plural-only and normal), verbs, and everything else. Follow the input format demonstrated in those cards and you\u0026rsquo;ll be golden. But just in case something isn\u0026rsquo;t clear, you can read the guidelines below. Shoot me an email at hello@monoglotanxiety.com if you\u0026rsquo;re confused or if you notice a bug.\nAt minimum, you need input for German and Translation. Auto-cloze rand color-coding require both Example and Info (for nouns and verbs) to work properly, and no auto-cloze card is attempted if no example sentence is provided.\nThe \u0026#39;info\u0026#39; field German nouns, verbs, and other words follow different sets of grammatical rules. This template works for all German words because it can determine what kind of word it\u0026rsquo;s dealing with and respond accordingly. The \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field contains grammatical information necessary for the auto-cloze and color-coding functions. For verbs, that means conjugations. For nouns, that means the plural form or a note indicating plural-only nouns.\nThis might sound a bit complicated, but it\u0026rsquo;s intuitive once you see it in action—and a lot nicer to deal with than a bunch of noun- or verb-specific fields that get left empty all the time. Just be sure to look at the examples and take note of the simple rules below to avoid getting frustrated. Pay special attention to how to use the \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field for verbs and nouns.\n   german: the German word. Nouns should be preceeded by their definite article (der, die, or das) and verbs should be in the infinitive. For reflexive verbs, add sich before the infinitive.  Examples: \u0026ldquo;der Hund\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;die Maus\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sprechen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sich wundern\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;abfahren\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;rot\u0026rdquo;   info: additional forms/information, usually only relevant for nouns and verbs.  Nouns: the plural preceeded by die. If the noun is plural-only write one of p, plural, plural only, or plural-only. For nouns with no plural, leave blank. Examples: die Hunde, die Mäuse, plural, [no input] Verbs: provide the 3rd person present, preterite, and past perfect conjugations in that order, with \u0026ldquo;, \u0026quot; separating the elements. Provide the auxilliary verb. Examples: \u0026ldquo;spricht, sprach, hat gesprochen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wundert sich, wunderte sich, hat sich gewundert\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fährt ab, fuhr ab, ist abgefahren\u0026rdquo; Other: leave blank or use for custom information.   translation: the translation example: example sentence. Try to avoid using words that start with the same stem as the word you\u0026rsquo;re quizzing to avoid confusing the auto-cloze (e.x. don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde freuen sich…\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;freuen\u0026rdquo; since Freunde will look like a version of freuen to the auto-cloze script). register: extra field for notes on usage/register. Shown on all card fronts, so be careful with spoilers. Examples: \u0026ldquo;wissenschaftlich\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;österreichisch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gehoben\u0026rdquo; image: an image. If you use attribution text for the image, include it below the picture and it will be displayed in small text beneath the image. german audio: audio file for the german word. example audio: audio file for the example sentence.  Known issues Tell me if you find more or if you come up with a fix! Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com\n Auto-cloze mistakes words that begin with verb stems for a version of the verb, and deletes them. Example: Using \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde meinen, dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind.\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;meinen\u0026rdquo; will result in \u0026ldquo;[…] Freunde […], dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind\u0026rdquo;.  Work-around: use a different example sentence.   Certain adjectives that change stem aren\u0026rsquo;t recognized by auto-cloze. Example: teuer –\u0026gt; teuren is not recognized correctly because the e and r switch places.  Work-around: use example sentences that take the base form of these adjectives.

    "description": "Interpolly is a free website that was built by a software developer who used YouTube to learn German. It allows you to create vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos, 100% for free!",
    "body": "Scrolling through Reddit today, I came across a great new website for German learners made by an r/German user. The site is called Interpolly, and it allows you to easily create German vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos. I checked it out and really liked the site, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write up a little review as a way of saying thanks to the developer for making this free tool for German learners.\nInterpolly works for Spanish, French, and a few other languages too. But the idea was inspired by the developer\u0026rsquo;s experience learning German by watching YouTube videos, which I think is super heartwarming.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t already checked it out yourself, German-learning Reddit tend to be really wholesome. At least, that\u0026rsquo;s been my experience, and the existence of free projects like Interpolly backs that up. People often post amazing free learning aides like this one and other resources that they make to help out other learners, and subs like r/German are some of my favorite places to look for new German-learning resources and tips. Interpolly was made by u/marcellki. Read their post introducing it to r/German here.\nTurn videos into German vocabulary quizzes with Interpolly You can either choose to browse Interpolly\u0026rsquo;s library of videos or provide a URL for a YouTube video to watch instead. Once the video starts, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a transcript show up like subtitles underneath the video. You can click words as they go by to add them to your words list and see a translation.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve added words to your list, you can turn them into a flashcard-like quiz that asks you to translate the German word to English. It seems like the suggested translations are drawn from other words in your list and from the video you used to make your list, which I think is a clever choice. It means that the various options all make about equal sense given the context of the video, so you actually need to know what the word means to get the answer right.\nFor instance, here\u0026rsquo;s a question from a dummy quiz I made based on a Kurzgesagt video about alien civilizations. Two of the words are related to the video, and one is another word in the list.\nThere are a few bugs, mainly with the translation of especially complicated words and a few verb forms. Still, I really enjoyed Interpolly, and would have really benefitted from this kind of site when I was first starting to learn.\nAt this point though, I understand most words in YouTube videos and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty attached to Anki when it comes to learning vocabulary, so I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be using it too much. But if the Interpolly developers ever add the option to export words to CSVs or spreadsheets that I can import to Anki flashcards, you can bet that I\u0026rsquo;ll be using it alllll the time.\nOverall, this is a really awesome, free tool. Just one more reason to love the online German-learning community.\nBased on the developer\u0026rsquo;s Reddit post, it seems like Interpolly is still under development and that the developers are looking for feedback. There\u0026rsquo;s a form on the Interpolly site where you can leave feedback.\n",

    "description": "Upgrade your pandemic daydreams of alpine tourism with this free Anki deck of 33 German words related to hiking",
    "body": "Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we\u0026rsquo;re at the \u0026ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies\u0026rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this free Anki deck of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won\u0026rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!\nThe deck uses my secret-sauce German Anki flashcard template to do things like automatically generate cloze deletions, color-code nouns by gender, and highlight irregular verb forms, and you can re-use the template for your own Anki cards! So I guess it\u0026rsquo;s not such secret secret-sauce after all\u0026hellip; Anyways. If you like the decks, you can throw me a bit of coffee change and pay-what-you-want. Otherwise just take the deck. I won\u0026rsquo;t judge.\n  Get the free Anki deck  And unlike my last booster pack, which consisted entirely of different German words for drunk, this deck contains vocabulary whose use I can actually endorse.\nMost hikes in Germany aren\u0026rsquo;t as alpine as you imagine Hiking is a a very popular tourist attraction in Germany, and there are a few well-known routes like the Mittelweg that are definitely on my bucket list. I think a lot of us think of mountains when we think of Germany—of dark, hilly forests and prestine lakes flanked by snowy peaks. Which is why you might be surprsied to learn that, despite its famous hilltop Disney castles and alpine waterfalls so instagrammable they are literally to die for, Germany is mostly not a mountain country.\nGermany\u0026rsquo;s topography is about a 50/50 split between flat, lowlying country to the north and higher hills and plateus to the south (this is interestingly also where the High/Low German division in linguistics comes from: High German dialects were literally higher in altitude than Low German dialects). Most people live in the flat lowlands in the north.\nThere are of course mountains in Germany, namely a few ranges in the interior of the country and in the southwest, and mountains extending into Saxony from the Czech border in the east. The latter are actually pretty impressive, and sometimes get called \u0026ldquo;Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland.\u0026rdquo; But when it comes to the German Alps… they start to rise just about where Austria begins. Most of those beautiful pictures of mountain lakes and valleys in Germany are from the fringes of the Alps that extend into Bavaria from across the southeast border to Austria. Germany\u0026rsquo;s highest mountain, the Zugspitze, actually lies on the Austrian border and is divided between the two countries at its western summit. That must have been complicated pre-Schengen… the summit border wasn\u0026rsquo;t opened until 1995.\n The alps begin about where Germany ends.\n I learned all this while living in Denmark, an even more mountain-less country where people expect even more mountains. Denmark looks more like the Netherlands than it does Scandinavia—more flat, idyllic countryside and painted cottages than dramatic fjords, snow-capped mountains, and forests haunted by the ghosts of long-dead Vikings. A German friend of mine actually showed up for her study abroad in Denmark with skis… needless to say, the skis ended up going home to Munich within a few months.\nSimilarly, my stereotypes of Germany generally went something along the lines of beer, lederhosen, little hats with feathers, and mountains. As I have now been helpfully informed by my boyfriend (who is Austrian and provided the Austrian usage notes for the \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; booster pack), that is actually a mostly Austrian stereotype. So I guess… Germany just pulled off a really good marketing campaign when it comes to alpine tourism, successfully convincing foreign tourists that mostly Austrian and Swiss mountain imagery is quintessentially German.\n…Or at least so my completely unbiased source would have me believe. Really, sometimes I feel like he\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Chekov from those old Star Trek episodes claiming everything good in the universe was invented in Russia, except with him it\u0026rsquo;s Austria.\n  Ahem. Anyways, that\u0026rsquo;s it for this week\u0026rsquo;s booster pack preamble. On with the German hiking vocabulary! I hope you enjoy, and let me know in the comments if you liked this deck, if I missed anything, or if you have suggestions for booster packs in the future.\nAh, and a quick Anki note: there\u0026rsquo;s a good deal of overlap in hiking vocabulary and vocabulary related to nature generally and outdoor sports, and that means of these words might show up in multiple decks I post here. Anki doesn\u0026rsquo;t like duplicate cards, so if you do end up downloading a second copy of a card, I reccomend that you consolidate the duplicates. I\u0026rsquo;ll write a post soon about how to handle this.\nGerman hiking vocabulary  wandern (wandert/wanderte/ist gewandert) - to hike gehen (geht/ging/ist gegangen) - to walk, to go sich verlaufen (verläuft sich/verlief sich /hat sich verlaufen) - to get lost on foot die Wanderung (-en) - hike der Wanderweg (-e) - hiking trail der Treck (-s) - trek der Pfad (-e) - path der Aussichtspunkt (-e) - scenic point der Wegweiser (-) - trail marker, signpost die Ausschilderung - signage die Genehmigung (-en) - permit, approval die Karte (-n) - map die Höhe - altitude die Navigationsgerät (-e) - GPS device das GPS - GPS (technology, can also mean GPS device) die Ausrüstung (-en) - gear, equiptment der Wanderschuh (-e) - hiking boots das Wanderstock (ö -e) - hiking pole, walking stick die Wasserflasche (-n) - water bottle der Wanderrucksack (ä -e) - hiking backpack der Trinkrucksack (ä -e) - hydration pack der Kompass (-e) - compass das Lagerfeuer (-) - campfire das Zelt (-e) - tent der Schlafsack (ä -e) - sleeping bag der Rucksack (ä -e) - backpack die Natur - nature, the outdoors der Naturpark (-s) - nature park (plurals in -e and -en also seen) der See (-n) - lake der Berg (-e) - mountain das Gebirge - mountainous region der Wald (ä -e) - forest   About \u0026ldquo;booster packs\u0026rdquo; I worked part-time in a board game shop a few summers ago, and like many board game shops this one made most of its income selling Magic the Gathering booster packs. While you might not need them to play the game, booster packs what make it fun (or addictive?).\nLearning vocabulary isn\u0026rsquo;t so different. You can get by with just the necessary words and should definitely focus on high-frequency vocabulary to start. But it\u0026rsquo;s the unnecessary words that make learning the necessary ones worth it.\nThe idea behind these vocabulary booster packs is to compile words that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t usually find in vocabulary list but that are fun, important in certain specific contexts, or actually useful but too charged or taboo for a typical German course to cover—think words like \u0026ldquo;tampon\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hiking pole.\u0026quot;\nI make these booster packs into free Anki decks with images, example sentences, plural forms, verb conjugations with highlighted irregular forms, and cloze deletions for each word. They use a special card format that automatically generates clozes and color-codes based on example sentences (a bit like this one except it works for verbs, too) that can be reused for your own cards as well!\nA new booster pack appears on the first friday of every month.\n",

    "title": "11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language",
    "date": "",
    "description": "There are more ways to learn to write a new language than just responding to prompts!",
    "body": "Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!\nBut what to write?\nFiguring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible. But even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a writer, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet you write a lot in your native language—it\u0026rsquo;s just not writing of the \u0026ldquo;sit down and fill a page\u0026rdquo; variety. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly shooting off texts, commenting, writing posts, emailing, making to-do-lists, and filling up planners. Why not squeeze some language practice out of those activities?\nThis list of my favorite 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language hits on more traditional methods for improving long-form writing. But I also did my best to make suggestions for ways to weave writing practice into everyday life and get practice writing the short-form, informal texts that fill our inboxes, calendars, and notifications. My hope is that, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a writing enthusiast or the kind of person who only reluctantly picks up a pen, there will be at least one thing this list that will feel approachable to you.\nBut first, there\u0026rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind no matter how you choose to practice!\nThe golden rule of writing practice: get feedback from native speakers Making mistakes helps us learn, and getting corrected ensures that you won\u0026rsquo;t practice being wrong. So when practicing writing in a foreign language, try to focus on writing things that are either public by nature (ex. comments, forum posts) or that you\u0026rsquo;re willing to have corrected by a tutor or on a platform like LangCorrect. Make mistakes out in the open, where someone can notice them and correct you. Usually they\u0026rsquo;ll be nice about it. And if they aren\u0026rsquo;t, you can revel in the knowledge that they unknowingly provided you with free language corrections by trying to be a jerk. If you\u0026rsquo;re nervous, remember that tutors are paid to be nice to you.\nWays to get your writing corrected by native speakers:  Post, comment, blog, and otherwise slap your writing down all over the internet in communities full of native speakers. Odds are, if you make an egregious enough mistake, someone will point it out. Reddit is a great place for this kind of practice. Post your writing on a site like LangCorrect, Lang-8, or iTalki to get corrections for free from native speakers. LangCorrect corrections usually come back within a day or so in my experience. Work with a tutor. Watching a piece of your writing get corrected live is a great way to get a good sense for the kinds of errors you tend to make. iTalki is a good place to find online tutors. Ask a friend or language-exchange partner for help once you have a solid relationship in place.  The silver rule of writing practice: ignore the golden rule That all said, all writing practice is good writing practice. I keep a journal in German that no one—no one—will ever see. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to see it. Grammar mistakes are one thing, but grammar mistakes in teenage angst at age 23 is another entirely. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do things *s u b o p t i m a l l y* if you want to, and incorperating language practice into things you might already do like keeping a journal or writing out grocery lists is pretty optimal if you ask me.\nOf course, more corrections means more progress. But more writing also means more progress. So whenever you can reasonably write something in your target language instead of your native language, do it—you can think about having someone correct your grocery list or youtube comment later.\nOk, so with that out of the way, here\u0026rsquo;s my list of 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language.\nHappy writing!\n11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language 1. Write an online journal on a language-exchange site There are a number of places online where you can write online journal entries and get them corrected by native speakers for free. Just be nice and correct a few entries in your native language in return. Lang-8, iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, and LangCorrect all offer exactly that. You could also check out the corrections board on the Polyglot Club.\nI personally favor LangCorrect because I feel like I get corrections back quickly and it\u0026rsquo;s obvious that the developers are working hard to steadily improve the site. Also, they seem more interested in making a good experience for people than making money, which is sweet. Unfortunately, Lang-8 isn\u0026rsquo;t taking new users at the time of writing. Also unfortunately, the iTalki community features are currently only fully available on mobile… and I hate typing things on my phone. That seems set to change soon, though.\nAnd as a last note: you can use these sites for more than just journaling. Pretty much anything, even just single sentences, is fair game.\n2. Find a pen pal An oldie but a goodie, exchanging letters or emails with pen pals is a fun way to get to know people from around the world and learn a thing or two about culture in addition to practicing your target language. Writing letters is also a great way to get practice with long-form texts. You can find pen pals on forums for language learners like Polyglot Club and on specialized sites. FluentIn3Months has a nice list of 10 websites where you can look for pen pals. Oh, and check the subreddit for your target language, too. My experience with r/German has been nothing but positive.\n3. Exchange messages with a chat partner Don\u0026rsquo;t want to write out long letters, or would you rather practice writing the way you\u0026rsquo;d actually communicate with someone in every day life? Then consider finding a chat partner to message in your target language. Bilingua, Hellopal, Hellotalk, Speaky, and Tandem are all purpose-built chat apps for language exchange, but there are plenty of other sites where it\u0026rsquo;s possible to connect with chat partners. iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, the subreddit for your target language, and language-learning forums like Polyglot Club are a good place to look for partners as well. And then there\u0026rsquo;s Idyoma, an app which aims at connecting people in the same geographic area for language exchange with the possibility of meeting in real-life—basically Tinder except for language exchange.\n4. Respond to writing prompts There are tons of websites out there with extensive lists of free writing prompts. Search for one in your target language, or just use any of the plentiful English resources out there.\nFor beginners, prompts for kids are fantastic. This prompt generator from My Cup Runs Over is amazing, with options to set your prompt level to elementary, middle, or high-school level. The prompt generator at Langauge is a Virus has plenty of beginner-friendly prompts, too. LangCorrect also has a large list of user-generated prompts, including plenty that are beginner friendly.\nFor intermediate and advanced learners, the New York Times maintains an amazing collection of writing prompts that\u0026rsquo;s available for free without a subscription. The Times also provides list of prompts for students organized by general theme. Resources for writers are also a great place to look for prompts if you have a good command of your target language and are into creative writing. Seventh Sanctum is a classic, and I like The Story Shack\u0026rsquo;s prompt generator a lot too since it provides very clear assignments.\n5. Do the writing exercises in textbooks, practice grammars, and practice exams —you know, those exercises that you skip because you don\u0026rsquo;t have a piece of blank paper on hand? Do them. And then have them corrected by a native speaker.\n6. Keep a bullet journal, planner, or calendar in your target language If you\u0026rsquo;re already writing daily in a planner or bullet journal, switching into your target language—even if not for all of your entries—is a great way to squeeze some extra practice out of an activity you\u0026rsquo;d be doing anyways. Practicing this way has the added benefit of ensuring that you\u0026rsquo;ll learn vocabulary relevant to your life, since that\u0026rsquo;s what goes into a planner or journal.\nBullet journals are a fad worldwide at this point, so you should be able to find a blogger writing about them in your target language and appropriate vocabulary from their posts for things like \u0026ldquo;weekly spread\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to-do list.\u0026rdquo;\n7. Write your to-do lists, grocery lists, and other notes to yourself in your target language Like writing a journal or planner, writing to-do lists and other mundane notes to yourself is a great way to practice the words and phrases most relevant to your life. If you already write lists and notes to yourself, you can get practice without budgeting any extra time for language practice. And if you\u0026rsquo;re really motivated, there\u0026rsquo;s always the option to type up your lists and post them online for corrections from native speakers.\n8. Join subreddits where your target language is used Reddit can be a bit intimidating, but if you can get past the old-school layout and occasionally aggressive users—and they\u0026rsquo;re easy to avoid—it can be a great place to practice a new language. To start, check out the subreddits for your target language. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll find lots of other learners and friendly native speakers who are happy to make minor corrections to posts when they see mistakes. These boards are also a great place to find language exchange partners, and tend to be very friendly. I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German and r/Danish.\nOnce you get a bit more comfortable, branch out and explore other subreddits where people post mainly in your target language. The country-specific subreddits for countries where your language is spoken are safe bets, and there are also more general subreddits specifically for content in various langages. For instance, r/de is for German (and sometimes English) content pertaining to all German-speaking countries. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there though—there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to explore, and especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning a rather \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; language with many speakers you\u0026rsquo;re sure to find all sorts of different subreddits where you can practice posting. Just be sure not to post questions about grammar/language-learning on country subreddits—that\u0026rsquo;s what the language-specific subreddits are for. Check the subreddit rules before posting and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine!\n9. Leave comments on youtube videos, blogs, and other online content in your target language Like posting on Reddit, commenting on your favorite videos, blog posts, and other content in your target langauge is a great way to practice expressing an opininon in your target language and—thanks to the public nature of comments—to get some free corrections. People love pointing out how people are wrong in comments sections, and that extends to grammar. For best results, maybe don\u0026rsquo;t start out by leaping into a heated debate. Some communities are more positive and likely to provide *kind* corrections than others.\nI once got more than 600 likes on a comment I left on a video from a German Late-Night Comedy show, so I\u0026rsquo;m basically famous.\n10. Write example sentences for your flashcards (and use them to make cloze deletions) Being a flashcard junkie, I of course had to throw a flashcard tip into the ring here. One, admittedly nerdy way to get some writing practice is to create example sentences for your flashcards. Example sentences are great on their own, but they\u0026rsquo;re even better when used to create cloze deletions, or cards where the word(s) you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn are removed from a sentence and replaced with a blank. Clozes are a great way to learn words in context. Just be sure to get the sentences corrected by a native speaker so that you don\u0026rsquo;t practice something incorrect.\nThe free spaced-repetition flashcard program I use, Anki, has an easy-to-use cloze deletion format you can use if you just want to create flash cards based no example sentences. Unfortunately, it isn\u0026rsquo;t so straightforward to add cloze deletions to your existing cards if they\u0026rsquo;re not already cloze-format. But if you\u0026rsquo;re learning German, I made a German Anki flashcard format that can figure out where the relevant words are in your example sentences to automatically generates cloze deletions. It color-codes nouns by gender, too. Currently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for nouns, but I have a version with support for verbs coming out soon!\n  Get the free template\n 11. Contribute to wikipedia pages in your target language I saved the nerdiest suggestion for last. You\u0026rsquo;re almost certainly familiar with Wikipedia already—but have you ever checked out Wikipedia in your target language? Chances are, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of content just waiting to be translated from your native language into your target language. You can get writing practice while simultaneously contributing to making knowledge accessible for free to people around the world.\nTo start with, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to translate content directly out of your native language into your target language. To find pages to edit or create, keep an eye on the sidebar on the left: languages in which a page on the current topic exists are listed. If your target language isn\u0026rsquo;t listed, that means that nobody has made a page in that language yet. And even if there is a page, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees that it will contain all the same information as the page in your native language. Browse through, look for places where you could add in a fact by translating, and then make your edits. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry about making a mistake here or there: if you do make a mistake, someone else can easily fix it later.\nYou can also do this in reverse, translating from your target language into your native language. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of fun translating pages and facts from German Wikipedia into English—like this one on an Austrian satirical political party that advocates for replacing a famous fountian in Vienna with a beer fountain, among other things.\n I hope you enjoyed this list of ways to practice writing in a foreign language. What are your favorite ways to practice writing? Have you tried any of the ways I\u0026rsquo;ve suggested? And did I miss anything?

    "title": "A candid review of Pimsleur Danish",
    "date": "",
    "description": "The listening-based approach is good for phonetically-tricky Danish, but the dialogue is weirdly irrelevant unless your primary motivation for learning Danish is picking up girls abroad.",
    "body": "I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I\u0026rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.\nThis is my honest Pimsleur Danish review after following the course for 30 days. And since I\u0026rsquo;m a nerd, I also worked through German 5 simultaneously to get a sense of how far Pimsleur could take my Danish if I stuck with it. So while this review is about Pimlsuer Danish, it draws on what I learned about Pimsleur generally by skipping ahead in langauge I speak at a higher level than Pimsleur teaches.\nPimsleur Danish Rating: ★★★☆☆  Price: $119.99 for 30 days/15 hrs of audio lessons s $14.99/month with the subscription model Positives\n Starts with speaking from day 1 Listen-and-repeat is great for pronunciation and an especially good fit for Danish Spaced repetition method backed by research Strict 30 min/day goal is motivating Audio format is very convenient - lessons can be done hands-free anywhere you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable speaking and have your smartphone (I did mine in the shower, but it\u0026rsquo;d be perfect for a commute)  Negatives\n Teaches tiny amount of vocabulary for 15 hours of study Conversation scenarios are often outdated and sexist and leave out important basics Feels more like memorizing set phrases than learning to speak most of the time Reading lessons are just lists of words to pronounce, not language in context High price (use the subscription version or get Pimsleur from your library) Not directly relevant, but Pimsleur clearly self-promotes on Reddit which enrages me 😠  Summary\nOverall, I can\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed. In a lot of ways, the course seems stuck back in 1963 when it was invented and it definitely falls short of its promise of \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo; conversation in 30 days. There is a real problem with dated social contexts and weirdly blatant sexism. And all those lessons on how to use your sub-A1 Danish to hit on married women in Copenhagen aren\u0026rsquo;t just annoying—they waste valuable space in Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s already slim curriculum. In 30 days, it barely teaches what you\u0026rsquo;d learn in one or two weeks of a textbook course. That said, going through the course did motivate me to start studying Danish again, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all bad. There is a reason Pimsleur is popular. Spaced repetition works, and by the end of 30 days you\u0026rsquo;ll understand basic conversations and have a decent feel for pronunciation. The listen-and-repeat format is convenient and an especially good fit for Danish because of its tricky pronunciation—and this \u0026ldquo;especially good fit\u0026rdquo; is ultimately why I chose to give Pimsleur Danish 3 stars rather than 2.\nAnd for the record, I reccomended Pimsleur to my mom, who is trying to learn Portuguese. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good system for folks who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to study a language on their own and just need to get a sense for how their target language sounds.\nThe basics: how it works and what you\u0026rsquo;ll learn As with other Pimsleur courses, each lesson of Pimsleur Danish consists of a ~30 min audio recording in which you are queued to respond in Danish both to random prompts (i.e. how do you say 56 in Danish?) and in conversational scenarios. Most prompts are given in English. Words are introduced and revisited later, often in slightly new contexts—this is is the spaced repetition method that made Pimsleur famous. When words are introduced, you are asked to repeat after one of the two Danish native speakers (one female, one male) and then you hear the native pronuciation again afterwards. Long words are broken down and introduced from end to beginning, which I found very helpful.\nMost of the lesson involves responding to prompts. You usually aren\u0026rsquo;t given a lot of time to think before one of the speakers says the answer and you\u0026rsquo;re given a chance to repeat it. That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing in my book—it reminds me a lot of how language teachers correct speech by repeating back an incorrect sentence or pronunciation correctly, modeling the correct version of whatever the student was originally trying to say.\nThe Danish course also comes with a reading booklet containing numbered lists of words and corresponding audio files that walk through how to pronounce them. The point of the reading exercises isn\u0026rsquo;t to learn how to read and understand content—many of the words aren\u0026rsquo;t introduced in the Pimsleur course at all, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a translation or context—but rather how to pronounce written Danish. Pronouncing written Danish is hard, so that\u0026rsquo;s important. But reading a list of random words you don\u0026rsquo;t understand isn\u0026rsquo;t a very motivating experience and doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with reading comprehension. I often didn\u0026rsquo;t complete the reading lessons.\nThe conversation scenarios tended to be oriented around the following topics:\n Greetings and saying goodbye Saying that you\u0026rsquo;re American and come from New York \u0026ldquo;I speak a little Danish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Do you speak English?\u0026rdquo; Asking what a word means and asking someone to repeat themselves Words for wife, husband, children, and friends Ordering food/drink at a cafe (a sandwich, coffee, tea, beer, wine, or water) Names of major Danish cities (and a few obscure ones) Telling time Numbers 1-100 Basic travel plans (car-focused, odd for DK)  For a 30 day course, the amount of vocabulary covered is very, very small. The first few chapters of any textbook will get you further. And this parcity of vocabulary only makes it all the more confusing that Pimsleur decided to devote a significant chunk of the lessons to topics like…\n Your big German car Gasoline prices How expensive wine is in Denmark \u0026ldquo;Where is Vesterbrogade?\u0026rdquo; Asking women if they\u0026rsquo;re travelling together with their husband Buying Legos for your kids Inviting someone back to your place Inviting someone back to your place after she\u0026rsquo;s said no 5 times  The perfect preparation for time travel to Copenhagen in 1963 The original Pimsleur courses were developed by linguist Dr. Paul Pimsleur back in 1963 and adapted for popular consuption in the 1970s. And if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the occasional reference to cellphones, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seem like they\u0026rsquo;ve been updated at all since. The social scenarios and dialogue often feel ripped straight out of the past.\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive a certain degree of conservatism in a language course that\u0026rsquo;s intended to be friendly to government and corperate customers. But the assumption that you\u0026rsquo;re a married upper-class businessman is very much baked into the course content, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not a married upper-class businessman, you\u0026rsquo;ll be left unable to describe yourself or get by in even very basic situations. And what\u0026rsquo;s worse, instead of learning useful things (like, say, the word for \u0026ldquo;food\u0026rdquo;), you waste time rehearsing sexist scripts.\nFor instance, in one lesson I had to ask a woman to come back to my place about 10 times, suggesting a different time of day each time she said no. There are more useful and less disgusting ways to teach time—discussing train schedules, for instance, which would have been a much more \u0026ldquo;travel\u0026rdquo; topic for Denmark than cars and gasoline prices, which is what Pimsleur chose to focus on despite Denmark not being a car country at all.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of Danish 1 but in German 5, there was a lesson that taught vocabulary related to flat tires and roadside assistance. And in in every. single. scenario, the female speaker needed roadside assistance or her husband to change the tire while the male speaker did it himself (often to save his poor wife the trouble of calling for help). Think: \u0026ldquo;I changed the tire, but if my wife had been travelling alone, she would have definitely called for roadside assistance\u0026rdquo; repeated in all its variations for 30 minutes.\nThis focus on cars strikes me as another businessman-bias, since a businessman is just about the only person I could imagine ever renting a car in Denmark (I\u0026rsquo;ll forgive the assumption in car-happy Germany). Pimsleur is really into cars. It taught me how to say \u0026ldquo;I have a big German car\u0026rdquo; before I learned to say where I live, and never touched on planes, trains, bicycles, or busses.\nAnd as one final example of both the sexist tilt and business-class bias, one of the very first things you learn is to ask people back to your place for dinner. I mean, maybe that makes sense if you\u0026rsquo;re a business-class businessman doing a business dinner in your Copenhagen business apartment. But for everyone else… it\u0026rsquo;s just weird. And worse, for a language course with a $120 price tag, it\u0026rsquo;s useless.\nCall me a buzzkill, but I think you should at least learn how to ask someone\u0026rsquo;s name before you start hitting on them in a language you can\u0026rsquo;t speak.\nAn \u0026ldquo;intermediate level\u0026rdquo; in 30 days of Pimsleur? Ok, so… no.\nJust no.\nI took the Danish Modul 1 test while living in Odense, so I have an idea of what you need to know in order to pass the absolute most basic test for Danish learners. The Modul 1 test isn\u0026rsquo;t even an A1-level test—it is sub-A1, a benchmark along the way towards preparing to take the real thing. For those of you not familiar with the CEFR language scale, A1 is the most basic level on a 6-level scale running from A1 to C2. The minimum level that could be considered intermediate would be B1.\nAfter 30 days of Pimsleur Danish alone, you would not be prepared for the Modul 1 test, let alone an A1 exam. So forget about \u0026ldquo;intermediate.\u0026quot;\nThis is something that really frustrates me about Pimsleur—and plenty of other language-learning products. I wish they\u0026rsquo;d just be honest with us about what they offered. Because even if Pimsleur was being honest, it would still have a good marketing pitch:\n \u0026ldquo;The perfect companion to classrom or individual study for on-the-go A1-level learners. Speak more spontaneously and improve your accent in just 30 days!\u0026rdquo;\n That\u0026rsquo;d be both honest and more helpful. For an A1 learner, Pimsleur offers a great way to get practice responding quickly in simple conversations and—what I see as its biggest advantage over other programs—to work on pronunciation.\nI wrote something similar in my post on Duolingo a while back, and it really does drive me nuts how often various resources oversell themselves as language-learning panceas. There isn\u0026rsquo;t any one resource out there that will teach you everything. There just isn\u0026rsquo;t. Every tool has its use (and some are more useful than others). Learners could get a lot more out of programs—and could be easily convinced to purchase additional resources—if it was clear exactly what each one was offering.\nBut while everyone oversells, Pimsleur oversells with chutzpah. \u0026ldquo;Converse at an intermediate level in 30 days\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t a promise it can keep—and I sincerely doubt any resource short of matrix-style brain downloads could. This stuff takes time.\nDespite its flaws, there are reasons to use Pimsleur After all this criticism, you might be wondering why I gave Pimsleur Danish 3 stars. And if I were writing this review just for myself and learners like me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rated it so high.\nBut despite that, I still reccomended Pimsleur to my mom. Why?\nFirst, ease of use: a course you can listen to while driving, cleaning, cooking, showering, gardening, petting a cat, or really anything else that doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with your ability to hear and speak requires almost no activation energy to use. And the fact that Pimsleur limits you to 30 minutes per day of study is hugely motivating for people who tend not to start learning new things because they find them intimidating (so most of us). It\u0026rsquo;s clear what you should to to learn each day and that makes it easier to stick with Pimsleur than, say, Duolingo, which allows you to set your own goals or none at all.\nSecond, Pimsleur teaches listening and pronunciation. If you\u0026rsquo;re not going to cough up the cash for lessons with a native speaker or find a language exchange partner somewhere, Pimsleur can help fill in some of the gaps when it comes to those very important skills. Of course, actually speaking is always, always going to be better than rehearsing conversations. But letting perfection get in the way of good enough is a terrible strategy no matter what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad Pimsleur and courses like it are out there for folks who can\u0026rsquo;t afford or arrange one-on-one time with native speakers. My mom could have found a tutor on iTalki, but realistically I know she\u0026rsquo;d be too embarassed to start from 0 in real conversations. And since I didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German for about a year after I started studying it, I understand the impulse. I\u0026rsquo;m not making that mistake with Danish and I really do reccomend speaking with a real person over an audio course if you can.\nThird, spaced repetition works, and even if you won\u0026rsquo;t learn very much vocabulary with Pimsleur you\u0026rsquo;re likely to remember the vocabulary you do learn. It\u0026rsquo;s a good foundation for building upon, and getting those first few words and \u0026ldquo;conversations\u0026rdquo; out of the way builds confidence. Spaced repetition also contributes to making Pimsleur a positive, motivating experience—it feels great to feel like you have answers to simpel questions on the tip of your tongue, and that\u0026rsquo;s what spaced repetition gives you in Pimsleur (although the responses are more rehearsed than spontaneous… which is why I see this as more of a motivation helper than a good language-learning strategy)\nSo yes, there are reasons the Pimsleur courses have stood the test of time and remain so popular despite their flaws.\nPimsleur costs too much, but there are (100% legal) ways to get around that problem If you think Pimsleur is the course for you, please, please don\u0026rsquo;t do what I did and pay $120 for 15 hours of audio lessons. I could have booked 8 lessons with my Danish iTalki tutor for that much. For what Pimsleur is, the price is too high. A lot of the price is definitely the brand.\nLuckily, there are some (legal, put away your pirate flags) options out there for getting around the price tag.\nFirst, Pimsleur offers a subscription version of its courses for $14.99/month. You get access to all of the material for a given language for as long as you\u0026rsquo;re subscribed—you just don\u0026rsquo;t get to keep the course afterwards. Since Danish has only one 30-day course, you\u0026rsquo;d only need to pay $15 to do the whole course over one month with the subscription model. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a totally fair price for what Pimsleur is. Almost 10x the price just to keep the recordings (which you should not listen to more than once anyways) isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it any way you slice it.\nAnother alternative is to check your library—thanks to Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s fame and long-time popularity, it\u0026rsquo;s a common item in library catalogues in the US. My library didn\u0026rsquo;t have all 5 German courses, but it had the first 3 and Danish as well.\nWhat do you think? Was this Pimsleur Danish review helpful? Have you tried out Pimsleur Danish yourself, or are you thinking of giving it a shot? Let me know in the comments below, and thanks for reading!\n",

    "description": "Don't be fooled by false friends like Klasse! Translating concepts like class, graduation year, and major to German is a bit complicated.",
    "body": "How do you say \u0026ldquo;class of 2020\u0026rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you\u0026rsquo;re from the US.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a \u0026ldquo;class,\u0026rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year. It\u0026rsquo;s such a basic concept in the US education system that I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how odd it can sometimes be until I had to explain it to my tutor earlier this week.\nWhat does class mean in English? For anyone who either didn\u0026rsquo;t go to school in the States or hasn\u0026rsquo;t watched enough American high school dramas to have figured this out: we here in the US primarily group students into social groups based on 1-year age differentials instead of on, say, common interests and course requirements (though students often socialize based on those things, too). This makes a bit more sense here than it might elsewhere, since it is typical for students beginning university to take a set of common classes (often called \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; classes) in a wide range of subjects before specializing. So you do tend to meet a lot of people who started studying in your year. And there are also things like fraternity and sorority culture, sports, student organizations, and other campus-life factors that further serve to separate students by year. It\u0026rsquo;s typical to ask someone their class when getting to know them—are you a freshman (1st year)? No, I\u0026rsquo;m a senior (4th year).\nPerhaps the most bizzare aspect of the \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; idea is that it often sticks with you long after you\u0026rsquo;ve finished studying. If all goes according to the usual plan, most of the friends you make while studying will belong to your class. Look around any college town or campus and you\u0026rsquo;ll find all sorts of little plaques indicating that whatever building or statue or bench (it\u0026rsquo;s often a bench) you\u0026rsquo;re looking at was paid for by the class of 1997 or 1960 or 2019 to commemorate their wonderful time together. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t unusual for high schools and universities to hold reunions in which alumni from a certain class come back together after 5, 10, or 20 years to judge one another on how poorly they\u0026rsquo;ve aged and enjoy the sweet, sweet schadenfreude that comes from seeing the guy who made fun of your braces in 10th grade gaze jealously at your new Tesla on his way out to the bus stop. The US is truly the greatest country on Earth.\nAnyhow, this concept doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the German-speaking world. And while the two words sound similar and both pertain to education, Klasse and \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; are false friends. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I learned from my tutor about how to talk about groups of classmates in German.\nWhat does die Klasse mean in German? Although Klasse sounds like the English word \u0026ldquo;class,\u0026rdquo; the two words rarely refer to the same thing. Eine Klasse is a group of school-age students who receive lessons together in the same classroom. It is not a lesson, lecture, series of lessons/lectures, or group of students who will graduate in the same year, and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use Klasse to refer to groups of university students.\nOne translation for Klasse in this context might be \u0026ldquo;classroom\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;classroom group.\u0026rdquo; In Germany and Austria, school-age students of the same age in school are separated into groups that are taught together. This is similar to how elementary school classes in the US are organized, except instead of a single teacher being responsible for each class the students are instructed in the various subjects by different teachers who rotate through the classrooms. Students in one Klasse don\u0026rsquo;t often interract with students in other Klassen, except if they take elective classes like Latin together.\nDer Jahrgang refers to students who started studying in the same year, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the same thing as an English \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the closest German translation of \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; in the sense of \u0026ldquo;class of 2020\u0026rdquo; is der Jahrgang—but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean exactly the same thing. Almost anything can have a Jahrgang. It refers simply to the group of all of a kind that were produced or born in the same year. \u0026ldquo;Vintage\u0026rdquo; might be a good translation for cases involving objects, as in the vintage of a wine, car, or design. When referring to students, a Jahrgang is a group of students who started studying in the same year. If Jahrgang is followed by a year, the year refers to when the students began studying, not when they graduated. So, if you were in the class of 2020, you\u0026rsquo;d be in Jahrgang 2016.\nHowever, unlike in the US, a student\u0026rsquo;s Jahrgang isn\u0026rsquo;t very important in German-speaking countries at the university level. Like elsewhere in Europe, students don\u0026rsquo;t take many courses together just because they\u0026rsquo;re the same age—by the time they start at university, they\u0026rsquo;ve already specialized. So there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;freshman core\u0026rdquo; everyone goes through together, and it is very rare for students to take courses outside of their major. And because it is common for students to have a lot of choice about the order in which they take their courses, study year isn\u0026rsquo;t as much of a natural division between students as it is in the US.\nYour Studienrichtung is likely more revelvant than your Jahrgang It is more typical for European students to think of themselves as belonging to a cohort of students in the same major subject as in the same study year. In German, die Studienrichtung means course of study or \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; in US English. Other words you might hear are der Studiengang and der Studienfach. The three words are roughly equivalent. In most circumstances, your course of study is far more relevant in terms of who you meet and spend time with at university than your class.\nIt seems there just isn\u0026rsquo;t a 1:1 translation of \u0026ldquo;Class of 2020\u0026rdquo; to German. This is just one example of how learning a bit about culture and society isn\u0026rsquo;t just a fun add-on to language learning—having a little context is helpful, sometimes even necessary, for understanding a new language.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Words to make sure you're prepared for your next trip to a Biergarten, with a free Anki deck and a funny song to help you remember them—even after a few drinks",
    "body": "Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I\u0026rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of free Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.\nGiven that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beer—so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor\u0026rsquo;s Travel forum: can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?\u0026quot; Is it even possible?\nThe answer, by the way, is no. I\u0026rsquo;m not so into beer myself, and I tried to visit Germany dry once. But the border checkpoint guy won\u0026rsquo;t let you through unless you finish off a full liter of beer (but not French beer) in front of him. Extra points if you drink it out of a boot.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;ll definitely need these words…\nJokes aside, if you do ever end up drunk in germanophone company and decide to flex your language skills, you can get by just fine with betrunken alone. An extensive list of synonyms is probably the last thing you\u0026rsquo;ll remember then anyways. But at least you\u0026rsquo;ll be well prepared to explain yourself the next day!\nThe angeheitert-hinüber continuum of German drunkness, with usage notes from a native speaker While all of these words mean \u0026ldquo;drunk,\u0026rdquo; they aren\u0026rsquo;t all equivalent. Just like \u0026ldquo;tipsy,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;inebriated,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;smashed\u0026rdquo; mean different things and are in very different registers, German words like beschwipst and besoffen mean very different things and aren\u0026rsquo;t used in the same context. Many are considered slang and could be rude in certain contexts, and others are more formal and more likely to show up in a newspaper than in conversation.\nBecause drunkenness is apparently pretty nuanced in German, I recruited my boyfriend to use his native speaker\u0026rsquo;s ear to sort these from least-drunk to most-drunk. He was sweet enough to help out, and provided some notes on connotation as well. But be warned: he\u0026rsquo;s Austrian, and Austrian German (or \u0026ldquo;cool German\u0026rdquo; as Clemens says) can be very different from German-German. So blame him if you raise a few eyebrows after whipping out one of these words in German company. The \u0026ldquo;super Austrian\u0026rdquo; words are marked with a little flag. 🇦🇹\nWords are listed from least to most drunk, from angeheitert to _hinüber _(which can literally mean dead). Clemens' notes on usage are in parentheses. If you want to have a shot at remembering these in an appropriate context, check out the free Anki deck. It has an image and example sentence for every card, and my German Anki template automatically color-codes nouns by gender, highlights irregular verbs, and generates cloze deletions from example sentences.\n  Get the free Anki deck!  I put a lot of love (and anxiety) into making my cards and Anki template, so if you like these decks you can pay-what-you-want. Or you can just download it for free. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;d do.\nAnyways, with all that said: Prost!\n18 ways to say \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; in German  angeheitert buzzed, happy angetrunken - buzzed (\u0026ldquo;feeling the alcohol already a bit\u0026rdquo;) beschwipst - tipsy, a little drunk and acting silly benebelt - befuddled, a little drunk and confused because of it eingespritzt - [🇦🇹] mildly drunk (\u0026ldquo;has drunk something\u0026rdquo;) alkoholisiert - [formal] intoxicated \u0026ldquo;only used by police and newspapers\u0026rdquo;) betrunken - drunk (\u0026ldquo;this is what happens if you continue with trinken\u0026rdquo;) berauscht - [very formal] inebriated angesoffen - [very slangy] pretty drunk in meinem Öl - [🇦🇹 very slangy] pretty drunk, in my drunkenness (\u0026ldquo;synonym for angesoffen\u0026rdquo;) besoffen - [very informal] sloshed paniert - [🇦🇹 slang] very drunk (\u0026ldquo;sehr österreichisch, also used for schnitzl\u0026rdquo;) blau - sloshed (\u0026ldquo;strong word\u0026rdquo;) zu - [very informal] sloshed (\u0026ldquo;synonym for dicht, blau, besoffen, and voll\u0026rdquo;) dicht - [very informal], sloshed, also means high (\u0026ldquo;good word\u0026rdquo;) voll - [very informal], sloshed, full fett - [🇦🇹 very informal] wasted (\u0026ldquo;very Austrian, there\u0026rsquo;s a song about it\u0026rdquo;) hinüber - incredibly wasted (\u0026ldquo;also means dead, Austrians would say hinig\u0026quot;)  Hear some of these words in action in this very Austrian song 🇦🇹 🍻  Did you get any of that? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you didn\u0026rsquo;t. Österreichisch can sometimes sound like a completely different language from Standard German—and there isn\u0026rsquo;t just one Österreichisch, either since there are lots of dialects just like in the rest of the German-speaking world. Still, listen to this stuff long enough and it starts to sound more like German. Looking at the lyrics while listening along can help a lot.\nThe song is pretty funny and worth deciphering. To get you started, the title in Standard German would be \u0026ldquo;heute bin ich wieder fett wie ein Radierer.\u0026rdquo; Not to give away the joke, but the song is roughly about how \u0026ldquo;drunk goggles\u0026rdquo; can sometimes have rose-colored lenses.\nAnd even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand or like the song, check out the comments section for a laugh. The comments sections on old Austrian songs are like some kind of bizzare oasis in the filth ocean of youtube comments sections—they\u0026rsquo;re always super wholesome. Everyone just seems to want to wave little mini Austrian flags along to the beat and share sentimental childhood memories. And they\u0026rsquo;re a good place to see how native speakers write online, which isn\u0026rsquo;t something you\u0026rsquo;ll find in a textbook.\nThe aftermath: blackouts \u0026amp; hangovers Last but not least, some words for the consequences of a long night out. Hopefully you never need this vocabulary, but it\u0026rsquo;s best to come prepared:\n der Filmriss (-e) - blackout, literally \u0026ldquo;tear in the film\u0026rdquo; einen Filmriss haben - to black out, to have a blackout der Kater (-) - hangover, literally \u0026ldquo;male cat\u0026rdquo; (maybe because they yowl?) der Katzenjammer (-) - [colloquial] hangover, literally \u0026ldquo;cat wailing/lamentation\u0026rdquo; einen Kater haben - to have a hangover einen Kater auskurieren - to nurse a hangover das Katerfrühstuck (-e) - hangover breakfast—where is this word in English?   A very cute hangover\n Get the free Anki deck of German words for drunk That\u0026rsquo;s it for this booster pack. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out the Anki decks if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing a set of hiking-specific words to lend some linguistic authenticity any pandemic daydreams of alpine hiking vacations that you might be nursing.

While you might not need them to play the game, booster packs what make it fun (or addictive?).\nLearning vocabulary isn\u0026rsquo;t so different. You can get by with just the necessary words and should definitely focus on high-frequency vocabulary to start. But it\u0026rsquo;s the unnecessary words that make learning the necessary ones worth it.\nThe idea behind these vocabulary booster packs is to compile words that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t usually find in vocabulary list but that are fun, important in certain specific contexts, or actually useful but too charged or taboo for a typical German course to cover—think words like \u0026ldquo;tampon\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hiking pole.\u0026quot;\nI make these booster packs into free Anki decks with images, example sentences, plural forms, verb conjugations with highlighted irregular forms, and cloze deletions for each word. They use a special card format that automatically generates clozes and color-codes based on example sentences (a bit like this one except it works for verbs, too) that can be reused for your own cards as well!\nA new booster pack appears on the first friday of every month.\n",

    "description": "Using the magic of German grammar, this Anki template automatically color-codes nouns by gender and generates cloze deletions without extra clicks or note types—just enter the word and an example sentence.",
    "body": "One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don\u0026rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.\nClearly easier.\nAnyways, since I did it already you don\u0026rsquo;t have to. I\u0026rsquo;ve made a template that automatically generates cloze deletions based on example sentences in basic card. And to top things off, it automatically color-codes nouns by gender. This is about as painless as making thousands of flashcards by hand gets.\nYou can download my Anki template for German for pay-what-you-want (so probably free) or from Ankiweb. One thing—thanks to German\u0026rsquo;s fun grammar, the auto-cloze feature doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs (yet, see my note at the bottom).\nIf you do test out the format, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you—especially if something went wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m happy and eager to fix any bugs you might find. Happy Anki-ing\nFeatures Automatically-generated cloze deletions generated based on the example sentence Anki basic cards and cloze deletion note types do not play nice. Usually, if you wanted to make a cloze-deletion for an example sentence from one of your basic note types, you\u0026rsquo;d need to either a) make a whole separate note for the cloze deletion or b) manually make \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; cloze deletions, which requires you to create aseparate fields for the complete sentence and the \u0026ldquo;clozed\u0026rdquo; version with your word removed and replaced a blank or other characters.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a drag, especially since cloze-deletions are a great way to learn words in context.\nThis card format makes generating cloze deletions painless—just provide an example sentence containing your word and a script in the template takes care of the rest! These \u0026ldquo;auto-cloze\u0026rdquo; cards aren\u0026rsquo;t true Anki cloze deletions, so they don\u0026rsquo;t require you to use a different note type for your clozes and basic cards. Auto-cloze cards are associated with the same Basic type note as the German-to-translation and translation-to-German cards. Thanks to a bit of grammar magic under the hood, this even works if your word appears in the example in an inflected form.\nNouns color-coded by gender based on article Nouns are automatically recognized by the card template and color-coded according to gender based on their preceeding article (der/die/das). Plural-only nouns are also color-coded—just write p, plural, plural only, or plural-only in the \u0026ldquo;Plural\u0026rdquo; field to indicate that a noun is plural-only. See the how-to for more on plural-only nouns.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like my color choices, you can change the colors of the masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural-only CSS classes in the \u0026ldquo;Styling (shared between cards)\u0026rdquo; in the card template window.\nIntuitive input format In my early days of exploring the wonders of custom Anki formats, I made the mistake of adding so many specific fields to my cards. One format I used for German had more than 8 fields at one point, with separate places to input noun articles, gender, plural forms, verb conjugations, and and and. It basically made the format unusable since I\u0026rsquo;d always make mistakes inputting information into all those fields. A lot of that is because Anki\u0026rsquo;s built in conditional replacement function only works based on field presence/absence. But 8 months later I have a solution to that problem and now the field bloat is finally over.\nI really wanted to keep things intuitive for these cards. The order of fields and expected format for input aligns with how German vocabulary is usually shared in lists—i.e. article + noun, plural, translation. And conditional formatting behind the scenes allows the same fields to be re-used for different kinds of words without causing any trouble. No separate fields for nouns and non-nouns or anything like that!\n  Get the template for free! (or pay what you want)\nYou can also download the template from AnkiWeb.\n Example Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick example of how nicely the cards work. Below are a screnshots of what I typed into the input window and the cards generated by the template:\nCard 1: translation to German Card 2: German to translation Card 3: Auto-cloze How-to Hopefully the uses for the fields are intuitive. But there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure that the auto-cloze and color-coding features works correctly. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of what you can put in each field:\nField 1: German\n a noun preceeded by its der/die/das article (die Maus ✅ , Maus ❌) an adjective, conjunction, or any other word that is… NOT a verb. Auto-cloze doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs (see the end note).  Field 2: Plural\n blank if the word in Field 1 is a noun without a plural form or if it is not a noun the plural form of the noun in Field 1, preceeding\u0026quot;die\u0026quot; optional (die Mäuse ✅ , Mäuse ✅) one of p, plural only, plural-only, or plural if the word in Field 1 is a noun without a singular form. This is important, since if this information is omitted your plural-only noun will be color-coded as a feminine noun.  Field 3: Translation: A translation of the German word into a language you already know\nField 4: Example sentence: An example sentence in German containing the word in Field 1. And here\u0026rsquo;s the magic bit: your word can appear in an inflected form, and auto-cloze will still work! (Ich sehe die Maus ✅, Ich sehe die Mäuse ✅ ). Do not treat this field like a cloze field (Ich sehe die Maus ✅, Ich sehe {{c1:die Maus}} ❌ ). The cloze is done automatically by a script in the card template.\nField 5: Image [optional]: An image (or multiple images) that relates to the word in Field 1.\nYou could easily add fields for audio or translations of your example sentences, but I wanted to keep things minimal to avoid field-bloat. If you have requests for new features/fields, just let me know in the comments!\n No verbs yet, but stay tuned Even for regular German verbs, the grammatical rules governing conjugation are much more complicated than for noun declension and adjective agreement. So making an auto-cloze format for verbs was a lot harder than making one for nouns, etc.\nI have a working auto-cloze template for verbs now that can also detect and highlight irregular verbs when the traditional 3-tense conjugation is provided (i.e. denkt, dachte, hat gedacht). However, I want to test it a bit more before making it available since its possible there are bugs I haven\u0026rsquo;t caught. And since getting verbs to work has been a lot of work, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably end up asking for a few bucks in exchange for the auto-cloze-everything-and-automatically-highlight-irregular-verbs card format.\nThanks for reading, and let me know how the template works for you!\n  Get the template for free! (or pay what you want)\nYou can also download the template from AnkiWeb.\n",

    "body": "In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it\u0026rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.\nA common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.\nUsing the wrong case with verbs for speech like sagen and fragen is a common German mistake Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole \u0026ldquo;Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache\u0026rdquo; idea. Yesterday, I ended up in yet another one of those \u0026ldquo;claw the brain apart\u0026rdquo; moments during a lesson with my iTalki tutor. We were going over a practice text I had written about a shy girl getting drunk at her friend\u0026rsquo;s birthday party (what a topic) and my tutor pointed out the following mistake in my writing:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben *mich gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nich früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich *sie erzählt habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n In both of the mistakes, I use the wrong case for the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; receiving the speech described by the verb. The correct way to write this would be:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben mir gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nicht früher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich ihnen erzählt habe, dass du schüchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s break down how I screwed up.\nWhat case to use with German verbs describing speech? First, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick look the common verbs used to talk about speech, sorted according to the case taken by the person being addressed. Almost all of these verbs take the dative, with two exceptions.\nDative\n sagen (to say) erzhälen (to tell) erklären (to explain) befehlen (to order) reden mit (to converse) sprechen mit (to speak) mitteilen (to share with) danken (to thank) gratulieren (to congratulate) verzeihen (to apologize) entgegnen (to counter/retort) widersprechen (to contradict/refuse)  Accusative\n fragen (to ask) bitten (to request)  So, what\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nRule: the person being addressed is usually in the dative case With the vast majority of German verbs for speech, the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; is in the dative case. Most of the time, this is because the verb is following German\u0026rsquo;s usual rules, but there are a few that just need to be memorized.\nOften, the listener is in the dative case because they are the indirect object of the verb. In a sentence, they \u0026ldquo;receive\u0026rdquo; whatever is spoken–an accusative direct object–from the speaker. Other common verbs describing speech take the dative because they are used with the preposition mit, which forces the following noun into the dative. Verbs describing speech that take dative listeners include:\n sagen (to say) erzhälen (to tell) erklären (to explain) befehlen (to order) reden mit (to converse) sprechen mit (to speak) mitteilen (to share with)  These verbs always take a dative listener—even if the accusative direct object is omitted. For instance:\nIch sagte ihm die Geschichte.\nI told him the sory.\nIch sagte ihm.\nI told him.\nSo these words aren\u0026rsquo;t irregular at all when it comes to case. They follow the usual rule stating that the direct object is in the accusative and the indirect object is in the dative.\nSome verbs describing speech don\u0026rsquo;t take indirect objects, but still put the person addressed in the dative case But there are a few sneaky ones that don\u0026rsquo;t (or almost never) take indirect objects and don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;mit,\u0026rdquo; but which still take dative listeners. And some of these are quite common, so they\u0026rsquo;re worth remembering:\n danken (to thank) gratulieren (to congratulate) verzeihen (to apologize) entgegnen (to counter/retort) widersprechen (to contradict/refuse).  Since these verbs don\u0026rsquo;t take direct objects, it\u0026rsquo;s common to see them followed by a subordinate clause beginning with \u0026ldquo;dass,\u0026rdquo; which explains why the thanking, congratulating, apologizing, etc. occurred. For instance:\nIch danke dir, dass du meinen Blogeintrag gelesen hast.\nThank you for reading my blog post.\nException: fragen and bitten are accusative verbs Luckily, there aren\u0026rsquo;t very many speech verbs that break pattern of using the dative case for the person being addressed: among the common verbs descrbing speech, only fragen (to ask) and bitten (to request) take the accusative. Even beyond just the context of describing speech, these verbs are pretty unusual. They number among only a handful of German verbs that can take two accusative objects.\nThis is one of those things you should just memorize. But one way I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get myself to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; the accusative here is to think about more aggressive forms of questioning. Just imagine an interrogation scene from one of those network crime shows that never seems to run out of seasons—lots of questions are asked, most of them pretty \u0026ldquo;accusative.\u0026rdquo;\n And in case you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering why I wrote that practice story about someone getting drunk at a party, the answer is that my awesome tutor had given me just about the most hilarious writing prompt ever:\nThere are a lot of words for \u0026lsquo;drunk\u0026rsquo; in German. Find as many as you can, and then write a story in which the main character is drunk.\nAll those words for \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; are coming up in another post. Cheers! 🍻\n",

    "description": "Change card styling and text in Anki based on the content of your note fields, not just whether they're empty or not empty",
    "body": "Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code for conditional formatting in Anki based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.\nOut-of-the-box, Anki supports \u0026ldquo;conditional replacement,\u0026rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty. This is how it works:\nShown always {{#Field}} Shown only if Field is not empty {{/Field}} {{^Field}} Shown only if Field is empty {{/Field}} Shown always That\u0026rsquo;s useful, but it has limitations.\nIf I wanted to use conditional replacement to color-code my German cards by gender, I would have needed to create different fields for the masculine, feminine, and neuter1 definite articles and be careful to only fill in one of those 3 fields as I made my cards. And that\u0026rsquo;s maybe even more of a pain in the butt than going through and color-coding everything by hand.\nLuckily, there\u0026rsquo;s a way to pull off content-based conditional formatting even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t baked into Anki. The solution involves a bit of CSS and Javascript, but trust me, it\u0026rsquo;s not too painful (definitely less painful than hand-formatting everything) and you can mostly copy-and-paste the templates below.\nCredit where credit is due: I didn\u0026rsquo;t come up with this myself. Look hard enough on Anki forums and you\u0026rsquo;ll find the answer (I found it here). But I wanted to save other code-illiterates the hours it took me to figure out how to make this work by going into a bit more detail and providing a concrete example.\nChanging card style and displaying different text based on field content The way this works is by using Javascript to change the CSS styling of some part of your card based on field content. You can also change what text gets displayed based on field contents as well. This card template shows how to do both:\nCard Template (front and/or back):\nNormal content \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_style'\u0026gt; Conditionally styled content \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_text'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional style--\u0026gt;\tif ('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementByID('conditional_style').classList.add('condition') }; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; if('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementById('conditional_text').innerHTML = 'conditional text' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card{ /* card style */ } .condition{ /* condition1 style */ } Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\nThe condition this card checks for is whether the text in field \u0026ldquo;Field\u0026rdquo; (creative name, right?) is exactly the word \u0026ldquo;condition.\u0026rdquo; If the condition is met, the conditional style span is styled by the CSS class condition (defined in the Styling box) and the conditional_text span is replaced by \u0026ldquo;conditional text.\u0026rdquo; If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met, then everything is styled by the card CSS class and no conditional text is shown.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re confused about how the JavaScript between the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags works, check out this page on conditionals in JavaScript and these on finding elements by their id, changing their CSS class, and replacing their internal HTML. The nice thing is that once you get how this works, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to adapt the basic idea to do whatever specific task you might have in mind. For instance, it\u0026rsquo;d be easy to condition your cards on other true-false conditions, like whether a field includes a certain word (rather than precisely equalling it).\nYou can also embed conditional text within a conditionally styled span. Which is exactly how my German noun flashcards work.\nExample: color-colding German articles by gender That\u0026rsquo;s all pretty abstract, so instead of ending there I wanted to quickly go through how my German flashcards work. I\u0026rsquo;ve only shown the template for the front of the German-to-English card since the code works the same wherever you paste it and this post is getting long enough already. You can download my deck from Ankiweb if you want to take a look at the card templates more closely (but it\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress and the templates are messier than the cleaned-up version I show here. You\u0026rsquo;ve been warned!).\nFields2: German, Gender, Plural, English, Example, Images\nIn the Gender field, I use \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; for masculine, \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; for feminine, and \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; for neuter nouns. I also sometimes use \u0026ldquo;p,\u0026rdquo; which stands for \u0026ldquo;plural-only\u0026rdquo; to distinguish feminine from plural nouns when there\u0026rsquo;s no singular form.\nCard Front:\n\u0026lt;big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{German}} \u0026lt;/big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;small\u0026gt;{{Plural}}\u0026lt;/small\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Example}} \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Images}} \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;m\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('m') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML= 'der' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('f') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('n') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'das' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;p\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('p') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card { font-family: arial; font-size: 40px; text-align: center; color: black; background-color: white; } .m { color: royalblue; } .f { color: palevioletred; } .n{ color: goldenrod } .p{ color: black } The result? Some nicely color-coded cards that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to color-code myself. And the best part is that this will automatically work on any new cards of this note type as well, which is great for me since I tend to mass-import cards from spreadsheets of vocabulary.\nFor anyone wondering, yes those are my cats. Their names are Hubble and Chandra. The dog (Jule) is my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s.\nHappy flashcarding!\n  I\u0026rsquo;d also need a field for plural nouns. Some German nouns only ever take the plural definite article \u0026ldquo;die,\u0026rdquo; which is identical in the nominative case to the feminine article. I color-code plural nouns differently as well, and this overlap of \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; is one of the main reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t conditionally format on an article field containing one of \u0026ldquo;der\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;das\u0026rdquo; but rather on a gender/plural field containing one of \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo;.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n These aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly the names of the fields I use, since I store more than one definition for each word on my cards. I simplified things for clarity.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ",

    "title": "Is Duolingo bad?",
    "date": "",
    "description": "Maybe, but it's still worth downloading. Here's why.",
    "body": "Is Duolingo bad? You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you\u0026rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom… This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nDuolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t bad if you use it effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet–you get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking Süddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired my Duolingo habit.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo—if you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\n Owl trophy image from https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/8613388/I-Have-Conquered-My-German-Treewith, edited by me\n",

    "description": "Knowing how to use the dative case is hard, but forming the German dative plural is easy... but I still screwed it up. Here's how not to.",
    "body": "In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary.\nAnyways, this time we\u0026rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the German dative plural.\nIch lerne Deutsch seit zwei Jahr…e…en. And I still make this common German mistake. One of the mistakes I notice myself getting corrected on most frequently is missing ns on my dative plurals. Take this example from a moment when I embarrrased myself trying to compensate for my monoglualism by pointing out how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come with German in two years…\n \u0026ldquo;Ich bringe mir seit nur zwei Jahre Deutch bei und habe bereits das Niveau B2 erre–\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Was?\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en, nicht Jahr-e. Du bringst dir seit zwei Jahren Deutch bei.\u0026quot;\n That sneaky \u0026ldquo;-n\u0026rdquo; marks the dative plural, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I often forget it when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about lengths of time. I suspect that this is because many of the German prepositions used to talk about time take the dative case, and we often talk about time in terms of plural units (seconds, days, months, years, etc.). While getting case wrong is a common mistkae, forming the German dative plural is actually easy if you can remember to use it.\nThe German dative plural Forming the dative plural is simple: Add an \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; to the end of the nominative plural. If the word ends in -n (i.e. Gärten) already, or ends in -s (i.e. Autos), don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. Remembering not to add the -n to plurals ending in -s isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard, because \u0026ldquo;Autosn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Opasn\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right.\n   nom. Singular Nom. Plural Dat. Plural     der Mann die Männer den Männern   das Jahr die Jahre den Jahren   die Maus die Mäuse den Mäusen   die Frau die Frauen den Frauen (no change)    As a reminder, the definite for the dative plural is den. The indefinite plural takes no article (called the \u0026ldquo;null article\u0026rdquo;). And the dative plural is very consistent. All the adjectives and articles that come a dative plural noun also end in \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;.\nDer Lehrer hilft den jungen Kindern. The teacher helps the young children.\nDie Jägerin versteckt sich zwischen den grünen Bäumen. The huntress is hiding between the green trees.\nEs ist den kleinen Mädchen kalt.\nThe little girls are cold.\nQuick reminder: when to use the German dative case Flip open any German grammar book and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the main uses of the dative case are:\n indicating indirect objects of verbs (ex. Ich gebe den Pferden einen Apfel) indicating who is affected by a verb\u0026rsquo;s action (ex. Sie schrieb ihnen einen Brief) following many prepositions (ex. zu, mit, seit, nach, etc.)  There are also some more specific uses that show up regularly but that I don\u0026rsquo;t see mentioned so often outside of hardcore grammar books:\n indicating possession of body parts, articles of clothing, prized possessions, and close relatives (ex. Den Waisenkindern sind gerade die Eltern gestorben) with adjectives, especially adjectives with zu or genug (ex. Diese Uhren sind den Kunden zu teuer.)  Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s more to the \u0026ldquo;how do I use the dative case\u0026rdquo; story than that. But that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another post.\nSo, did you find this autopsy of my attempt to use the dative plural helpful? Do you find it hard to remember the German cases, or would you never make a mistake like this? In any case, thanks for reading, vielen Dank, and tusind tak!\n",
