    "body": "Duolingo gets a lot of flack in some corners of the language-learning internet, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom… This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool—relying on Duolingo as your primary mode of learning won\u0026rsquo;t work well for all the reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve already discussed—but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nHow to use Duolingo effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet–you get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking Süddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired. I\u0026rsquo;ve also started using flashcards more on my phone as well.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo—if you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\n",

    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn\u0026rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have tried, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.\nDespite having studied the language for 2 years, I could barely understand him at the beginning. But with time, I learned to learned to map his upper-Austrian dialect onto my patchy foreigner\u0026rsquo;s Hochdeutsch. That was the easy part. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning to stop worrying about making mistakes—and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized how important it is that I do.\nScrewing up is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe even necessary. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing it when it comes to learning. I can almost feel my brain tying neurons together in a frenzy of embarrased desparation every time I\u0026rsquo;m corrected.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the idea behind \u0026ldquo;Fehler Files,\u0026rdquo; a new series I\u0026rsquo;m kicking off in this post. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing real ways I\u0026rsquo;ve screwed up speaking German in short posts so you can experience that feeling embarrased desparation vicariously (though I won\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s a substitute for the real deal. Go find your own person to point out all your flaws—grammatical and otherwise—for you, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing better). It will hopefully add up to something like a collection of bite-sized grammar reviews of topics that are both tricky and common enough to give a B1/B2-level speaker trouble.\nTo start things off, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how I\u0026rsquo;ve butchered the German dative plural.\nIch lerne Deutsch seit zwei Jahr…e…en. And I still can\u0026rsquo;t remember the dative plural One of the mistakes I notice myself getting corrected on most frequently is missing ns on my dative plurals. Take this example from a moment when I embarrrased myself trying to compensate for my monoglualism by pointing out how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come with German in two years…\n \u0026ldquo;Ich bringe mir seit nur zwei Jahre Deutch bei und habe bereits das Niveau B2 erre–\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Was?\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en, nicht Jahr-e. Du bringst dir seit zwei Jahren Deutch bei.\u0026quot;\n That sneaky \u0026ldquo;-n\u0026rdquo; marks the dative plural, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I often forget it when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about lengths of time. I suspect that this is because many of the German prepositions used to talk about time take the dative case, and we often talk about time in terms of plural units (seconds, days, months, years, etc.).\nSo, here\u0026rsquo;s a reminder—to you and to me—that the dative plural exists! And it does show up in a lot of contexts (especially to indicate the indirect object of verbs and with certain prepositions), so it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember.\nThe dative plural Making the dative plural is simple: Add an \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; to the end of the nominative plural. If the word ends in -n (i.e. Gärten) already, or ends in -s (i.e. Autos), don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. Remembering not to add the -n to plurals ending in -s isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard, because \u0026ldquo;Autosn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Opasn\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right.\n   nom. Singular Nom. Plural Dat. Plural     der Mann die Männer den Männern   das Jahr die Jahre den Jahren   die Maus die Mäuse den Mäusen   die Frau die Frauen den Frauen (no change)    As a reminder, the definite for the dative plural is den. The indefinite plural takes no article (called the \u0026ldquo;null article\u0026rdquo;). And the dative plural is very consistent. All the adjectives and articles that come a dative plural noun also end in \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;.\nDer Lehrer hilft den jungen Kindern. The teacher helps the young children.\nDie Jägerin versteckt sich zwischen den grünen Bäumen. The huntress is hiding between the green trees.\nEs ist den kleinen Mädchen kalt.\nThe little girls are cold.\nQuick reminder: when to use the dative Flip open any German grammar book and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the main uses of the dative case are:\n indicating indirect objects of verbs (ex. Ich gebe den Pferden einen Apfel) indicating who is affected by a verb\u0026rsquo;s action (ex. Sie schrieb ihnen einen Brief) following many prepositions (ex. zu, mit, seit, nach, etc.)  There are also some more specific uses that show up regularly but that I don\u0026rsquo;t see mentioned so often outside of hardcore grammar books:\n indicating possession of body parts, articles of clothing, prized possessions, and close relatives (ex. Den Waisenkindern sind gerade die Eltern gestorben) with adjectives, especially adjectives with zu or genug (ex. Diese Uhren sind den Kunden zu teuer.)  I won\u0026rsquo;t go into these here now, since I plan on coming back to the dative case later and breaking each of these down in more detail in regular posts.\n I hope this first Fehler Files post was useful for you. Let me know what you think in the comments, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget your dative plurals!\n",

    "body": "Being the good cornfed American girl that I am, I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn a second language growing up, and I ended up develop a nasty case of I now affectionately call monoglot anxiety: a sort of wallowing, often jealous panic surrounding having never learned to speak a second language, and fear of inevitably screwing up all the time if I did try to learn one.\nFor years, it held me back, but eventually, it drove me bonkers enough to grind to the end of Duolingo German.\nAnxiety is, for the record, never the best reason to do anything (and Duolingo is, for the record, not necessarily the best way to start learning a language). But in the absence of other motivators, anxiety sometimes gets the job done.\nAnyways, one thing led to another and now I have a language blog.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not an expert—more an enthusiastic fan. I can\u0026rsquo;t humble-brag on the 15 languages I\u0026rsquo;ve taught myself like all those internet polyglots who run language sites. So you won\u0026rsquo;t find promises of fluency in X amount of time here, nor any #inspiration. You will find what I hope is an entertaining take on language and language learning, written by someone who\u0026rsquo;s in this for fun, not perfection.\nAside: humble-bragging is totally justified if you\u0026rsquo;ve taught yourself 15 languages\u0026hellip; But just because you\u0026rsquo;ve earned it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I have to like it!\n I write about all sort of language topics, but this blog definitely has a specific focus on German. I share a lot of German-specific tips and resources, including new Anki decks and vocabulary lists every two weeks.\n",
