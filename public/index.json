    "description": "I tell 'dir' but ask 'dich.' Why? A quick review of the cases taken by verbs describing speech like sagen, fragen, and erz√§hlen",
    "body": "Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole \u0026ldquo;Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache\u0026rdquo; idea. And I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that many of the words that most often initiate a holy-$h!#-what-case-do-I-use death-spiral are the common verbs describing speech: sagen, fragen, and co.\nThe funny thing is, these verbs actually mostly‚Äìand I\u0026rsquo;ll\u0026rsquo;get to the mostly bit‚Äìbehave according to the usual rules dictating case in German. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m getting this wrong all the time because I\u0026rsquo;m over-correcting for the apparent randomness of other common German verbs‚Ä¶ or maybe I just never learned these properly. Either way, you can easily avoid making the mistakes I made just by taking a second to peek at the grammar of these common verbs.\nHow not to do it Yesterday I got myself confused about again this during a lesson with my iTalki tutor. We were going over a practice text I had written about a shy girl getting drunk at her friend\u0026rsquo;s birthday party (what a topic) and my tutor pointed out the following mistake in my writing:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben *mich gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nich fr√ºher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich *sie erz√§hlt habe, dass du sch√ºchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n In both of the mistakes, I use the wrong case for the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; receiving speech described by the underlined verb. The correct way to write this would be:\n \u0026ldquo;Alle meine Freunde haben mir gefragt, warum ich dich ihnen nicht fr√ºher vorgestellt habe. Sie glaubten es nicht, als ich ihnen erz√§hlt habe, dass du sch√ºchtern bist und keine Partys mag.\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s break down how I screwed up.\nThe person being spoken to is usually in the dative case With the vast majority of German verbs for speech, the \u0026ldquo;listener\u0026rdquo; is in the dative case. Most of the time, this is because the verb is following German\u0026rsquo;s usual rules, but there are a few that just need to be memorized.\nOften, the listener is in the dative case because they are the indirect object of the verb. In a sentence, they \u0026ldquo;receive\u0026rdquo; whatever is spoken‚Äìan accusative direct object‚Äìfrom the speaker. Verbs that are used this way include sagen (to say), erzh√§len (to tell), erkl√§ren (to explain), and befehlen (to order).\nThese verbs always take a dative listener‚Äîeven if the accusative direct object is omitted. For instance:\nIch sagte ihm die Geschichte.\nI told him the sory.\nIch sagte ihm.\nI told him.\nOther common verbs describing speech that also \u0026ldquo;follow the rules\u0026rdquo; take dative listeners because they are used mit, which forces the following noun into the dative. These verbs include reden mit (to converse), sprechen mit (to speak), and mitteilen (to share with).\nSo these words aren\u0026rsquo;t irregular at all when it comes to case. They follow the usual rule stating that the direct object is in the accusative and the indirect object is in the dative.\nBut there are a few sneaky ones that don\u0026rsquo;t (or almost never) take indirect objects and don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;mit,\u0026rdquo; but which still take dative listeners. And some of these are quite common, so they\u0026rsquo;re worth remembering: danken (to thank), gratulieren (to congratulate), verzeihen (to apologize), entgegnen (to counter/retort), and widersprechen (to contradict/refuse). Since these verbs don\u0026rsquo;t take direct objects, it\u0026rsquo;s common to see them followed by a subordinate clause beginning with \u0026ldquo;dass,\u0026rdquo; which explains why the thanking, congratulating, apologizing, etc. occurred. For instance:\nIch danke dir, dass du meinen Blogeintrag gelesen hast.\nThank you for reading my blog post.\nBut fragen and bitten take the accusative Luckily, there aren\u0026rsquo;t very many speech verbs that break pattern and use the accusative case for the person being spoken: among the common verbs, fragen (to ask) and bitten (to request) are the only ones. Even beyond just the context of describing speech, these verbs are pretty unusual. They number among only a handful of German verbs that can take two accusative objects.\nThis is one of those things you should just memorize. But one way I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get myself to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; the accusative here is to think about more aggressive forms of questioning. Just think of how it feels when you\u0026rsquo;re questioned \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; rather than asked \u0026ldquo;of.\u0026rdquo; For a more concrete example, just imagine an interrogation scene from one of those network crime shows that never seems to run out of seasons‚Äîlots of questions are asked, most of them pretty \u0026ldquo;accusative.\u0026rdquo;\n And in case you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering why I wrote that practice story about someone getting drunk at a party, the answer is that my awesome tutor had given me just about the most hilarious writing prompt ever:\nThere are a lot of words for \u0026lsquo;drunk\u0026rsquo; in German. Find as many as you can, and then write a story in which the main character is drunk.\nAll those words for \u0026ldquo;drunk\u0026rdquo; are coming up in the next post. Cheers! üçª\n",

    "description": "Change card styling and text based on the content of your note fields, not just whether they're empty or not empty",
    "body": "Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you‚Äôll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it‚Äôs not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.\nOut-of-the-box, Anki supports \u0026ldquo;conditional replacement,\u0026rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty. This is how it works:\nShown always {{#Field}} Shown only if Field is not empty {{/Field}} {{^Field}} Shown only if Field is empty {{/Field}} Shown always That\u0026rsquo;s useful, but it has limitations.\nIf I wanted to use conditional replacement to color-code my German cards by gender, I would have needed to create different fields for the masculine, feminine, and neuter1 definite articles and be careful to only fill in one of those 3 fields as I made my cards. And that\u0026rsquo;s maybe even more of a pain in the butt than going through and color-coding everything by hand.\nLuckily, there\u0026rsquo;s a way to pull off content-based conditional formatting even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t baked into Anki. The solution involves a bit of CSS and Javascript, but trust me, it\u0026rsquo;s not too painful (definitely less painful than hand-formatting everything) and you can mostly copy-and-paste the templates below.\nCredit where credit is due: I didn\u0026rsquo;t come up with this myself. Look hard enough on Anki forums and you\u0026rsquo;ll find the answer (I found it here). But I wanted to save other code-illiterates the hours it took me to figure out how to make this work by going into a bit more detail and providing a concrete example.\nChanging card style and displaying different text based on field content The way this works is by using Javascript to change the CSS styling of some part of your card based on field content. You can also change what text gets displayed based on field contents as well. This card template shows how to do both:\nCard Template (front and/or back):\nNormal content \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_style'\u0026gt; Conditionally styled content \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id = 'conditional_text'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- conditional style--\u0026gt;\tif ('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementByID('conditional_style').classList.add('condition') }; \u0026lt;!-- conditional text--\u0026gt; if('{{Field}}' == 'condition'){ document.getElementById('conditional_text').innerHTML = 'conditional text' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card{ /* card style */ } .condition{ /* condition1 style */ } Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\nThe condition this card checks for is whether the text in field \u0026ldquo;Field\u0026rdquo; (creative name, right?) is exactly the word \u0026ldquo;condition.\u0026rdquo; If the condition is met, the conditional style span is styled by the CSS class condition (defined in the Styling box) and the conditional_text span is replaced by \u0026ldquo;conditional text.\u0026rdquo; If the condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met, then everything is styled by the card CSS class and no conditional text is shown.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re confused about how the JavaScript between the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags works, check out this page on conditionals in JavaScript and these on finding elements by their id, changing their CSS class, and replacing their internal HTML. The nice thing is that once you get how this works, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to adapt the basic idea to do whatever specific task you might have in mind. For instance, it\u0026rsquo;d be easy to condition your cards on other true-false conditions, like whether a field includes a certain word (rather than precisely equalling it).\nYou can also embed conditional text within a conditionally styled span. Which is exactly how my German noun flashcards work.\nExample: color-colding German articles by gender That\u0026rsquo;s all pretty abstract, so instead of ending there I wanted to quickly go through how my German flashcards work. I\u0026rsquo;ve only shown the template for the front of the German-to-English card since the code works the same wherever you paste it and this post is getting long enough already. You can download my deck from Ankiweb if you want to take a look at the card templates more closely (but it\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress and the templates are messier than the cleaned-up version I show here. You\u0026rsquo;ve been warned!).\nFields2: German, Gender, Plural, English, Example, Images\nIn the Gender field, I use \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; for masculine, \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; for feminine, and \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; for neuter nouns. I also sometimes use \u0026ldquo;p,\u0026rdquo; which stands for \u0026ldquo;plural-only\u0026rdquo; to distinguish feminine from plural nouns when there\u0026rsquo;s no singular form.\nCard Front:\n\u0026lt;big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span id=\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{German}} \u0026lt;/big\u0026gt; \u0026lt;small\u0026gt;{{Plural}}\u0026lt;/small\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Example}} \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; {{Images}} \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;m\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('m') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML= 'der' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('f') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('n') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'das' } else if (\u0026quot;{{Gender}}\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;p\u0026quot;) { document.getElementById(\u0026quot;gender_color\u0026quot;).classList.add('p') document.getElementById(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;).innerHTML = 'die' }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Styling (shared between cards):\n.card { font-family: arial; font-size: 40px; text-align: center; color: black; background-color: white; } .m { color: royalblue; } .f { color: palevioletred; } .n{ color: goldenrod } .p{ color: black } The result? Some nicely color-coded cards that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to color-code myself. And the best part is that this will automatically work on any new cards of this note type as well, which is great for me since I tend to mass-import cards from spreadsheets of vocabulary.\nFor anyone wondering, yes those are my cats. Their names are Hubble and Chandra. The dog (Jule) is my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s.\nHappy flashcarding!\n  I\u0026rsquo;d also need a field for plural nouns. Some German nouns only ever take the plural definite article \u0026ldquo;die,\u0026rdquo; which is identical in the nominative case to the feminine article. I color-code plural nouns differently as well, and this overlap of \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; is one of the main reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t conditionally format on an article field containing one of \u0026ldquo;der\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;die\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;das\u0026rdquo; but rather on a gender/plural field containing one of \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo;. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n These aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly the names of the fields I use, since I store more than one definition for each word on my cards. I simplified things for clarity. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ",

    "description": "Any language-learning tool that can compete against social media and mobile games for our attention is worth giving a shot",
    "body": "Duolingo gets a lot of flack in some corners of the language-learning internet, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom‚Ä¶ This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nHow to use Duolingo effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet‚Äìyou get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking S√ºddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired my Duolingo habit.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo‚Äîif you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\n Owl trophy image from https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/8613388/I-Have-Conquered-My-German-Treewith,¬†edited by me\n",

    "body": "I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn\u0026rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have tried, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.\nDespite having studied the language for 2 years, I could barely understand him at the beginning. But with time, I learned to learned to map his upper-Austrian dialect onto my patchy foreigner\u0026rsquo;s Hochdeutsch. That was the easy part. I\u0026rsquo;m still learning to stop worrying about making mistakes‚Äîand I\u0026rsquo;ve realized how important it is that I do.\nScrewing up is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe even necessary. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing it when it comes to learning. I can almost feel my brain tying neurons together in a frenzy of embarrased desparation every time I\u0026rsquo;m corrected.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the idea behind \u0026ldquo;Fehler Files,\u0026rdquo; a new series I\u0026rsquo;m kicking off in this post. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing real ways I\u0026rsquo;ve screwed up speaking German in short posts so you can experience that feeling embarrased desparation vicariously (though I won\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s a substitute for the real deal. Go find your own person to point out all your flaws‚Äîgrammatical and otherwise‚Äîfor you, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing better). It will hopefully add up to something like a collection of bite-sized grammar reviews of topics that are both tricky and common enough to give a B1/B2-level speaker trouble.\nTo start things off, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how I\u0026rsquo;ve butchered the German dative plural.\nIch lerne Deutsch seit zwei Jahr‚Ä¶e‚Ä¶en. And I still can\u0026rsquo;t remember the dative plural One of the mistakes I notice myself getting corrected on most frequently is missing ns on my dative plurals. Take this example from a moment when I embarrrased myself trying to compensate for my monoglualism by pointing out how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come with German in two years‚Ä¶\n \u0026ldquo;Ich bringe mir seit nur zwei Jahre Deutch bei und habe bereits das Niveau B2 erre‚Äì\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Was?\u0026rdquo;\nJahr-en, nicht Jahr-e. Du bringst dir seit zwei Jahren Deutch bei.\u0026quot;\n That sneaky \u0026ldquo;-n\u0026rdquo; marks the dative plural, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I often forget it when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about lengths of time. I suspect that this is because many of the German prepositions used to talk about time take the dative case, and we often talk about time in terms of plural units (seconds, days, months, years, etc.).\nSo, here\u0026rsquo;s a reminder‚Äîto you and to me‚Äîthat the dative plural exists! And it does show up in a lot of contexts (especially to indicate the indirect object of verbs and with certain prepositions), so it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember.\nThe dative plural Making the dative plural is simple: Add an \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; to the end of the nominative plural. If the word ends in -n (i.e. G√§rten) already, or ends in -s (i.e. Autos), don\u0026rsquo;t change anything. Remembering not to add the -n to plurals ending in -s isn\u0026rsquo;t so hard, because \u0026ldquo;Autosn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Opasn\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right.\n   nom. Singular Nom. Plural Dat. Plural     der Mann die M√§nner den M√§nnern   das Jahr die Jahre den Jahren   die Maus die M√§use den M√§usen   die Frau die Frauen den Frauen (no change)    As a reminder, the definite for the dative plural is den. The indefinite plural takes no article (called the \u0026ldquo;null article\u0026rdquo;). And the dative plural is very consistent. All the adjectives and articles that come a dative plural noun also end in \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;.\nDer Lehrer hilft den jungen Kindern. The teacher helps the young children.\nDie J√§gerin versteckt sich zwischen den gr√ºnen B√§umen. The huntress is hiding between the green trees.\nEs ist den kleinen M√§dchen kalt.\nThe little girls are cold.\nQuick reminder: when to use the dative Flip open any German grammar book and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the main uses of the dative case are:\n indicating indirect objects of verbs (ex. Ich gebe den Pferden einen Apfel) indicating who is affected by a verb\u0026rsquo;s action (ex. Sie schrieb ihnen einen Brief) following many prepositions (ex. zu, mit, seit, nach, etc.)  There are also some more specific uses that show up regularly but that I don\u0026rsquo;t see mentioned so often outside of hardcore grammar books:\n indicating possession of body parts, articles of clothing, prized possessions, and close relatives (ex. Den Waisenkindern sind gerade die Eltern gestorben) with adjectives, especially adjectives with zu or genug (ex. Diese Uhren sind den Kunden zu teuer.)  I won\u0026rsquo;t go into these here now, since I plan on coming back to the dative case later and breaking each of these down in more detail in regular posts.\n I hope this first Fehler Files post was useful for you. Let me know what you think in the comments, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget your dative plurals!\n",
