Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.\nAnyhow, you can expect to see a little update from me every week from here on. Each entry in my \u0026ldquo;language diary\u0026rdquo; here will lay out the languages I\u0026rsquo;m working on at the moment and the resources I\u0026rsquo;m using before briefly exploring a little question I had related to language learning in the previous week.\nLanguage Diary #1 ‚Äî January 27, 2022\nActive languages: Italian (~A1-) and German (~B2+)\nLanguages on-hold: Spanish (~A1) and Danish (~A1-)\nItalian - beginner (maaaybe A1?)\n Total time studied: ~3 months Current focus streak: ~1 month Learner resources: Speakly, Learn Italian with Lucrezia, Easy Italian, Modern Italian Grammar, iTalki tutor Native content: Storia di Roma (way too hard, just for background noise while running)  German - advanced (B2+)\n Total time studied: ~2.75 years Current focus streak: ~2.75 years Resources in use: Speakly, Slowly, my boyfriend, speaking partner Native content: MrWissen2Go, Kurzgesagt, Dark, ORF.at, Drachenfeuer by Wolfgang Hohlbein    After a detour through Spanish, I\u0026rsquo;m back to Italian and loving it I started dabbling in Italian in early fall, but Spanish really captured my interest in November and December and I took a detour into Spanish for a while. These days my motivation has swung a full 180 back towards Italian and Italian has been my focus for the past month or so.\nOne key factor in motivating me to commit to Italian for now is my amazing tutor on iTalki. I used to think that lessons for true beginners were mostly a waste of time and money, but my first lesson with my Italian tutor really changed my mind. A skilled teacher can definitely make a difference at the beginning ‚Äî though I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pay for casual conversation practice until I can, you know, kinda hold a casual conversation.\nWhat about Spanish? I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely be back to Spanish ‚Äî¬†I know I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to resist forever! I\u0026rsquo;ve been waffling between the two sister languages since November, but I\u0026rsquo;ve committed to Italian until the beginning of April for now. I\u0026rsquo;ll re-evaluate how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling about Spanish at that point.\nLong-term, my goal is to get Italian to around B1 (or wherever \u0026ldquo;conversational fluency\u0026rdquo; ends up being) and then focus on getting to that point with either Spanish or Danish depending on motivation.\nContinuing to plink along with German With German it\u0026rsquo;s been all B2-to-C1 plateau business as usual: chatting with a speaking partner at least once a week, using Speakly (10 words/day), writing to penpals, and consuming as much native content as I can. I\u0026rsquo;m very motivated for Italian at the moment, and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that all the Italian input I\u0026rsquo;ve been consuming is carving out chunks of time and attention I\u0026rsquo;d usually siphon into German.\nA major victory in the last few weeks was finally convincing my (German-speaking) boyfriend to watch Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Dark with me in German, which over all 3 seasons was around 28 hours of input. Not bad. I\u0026rsquo;m also speaking more German with him at home lately, which has been a nice little shift.\nHow should you choose which of your target languages to focus on? Following my gut and deciding to focus on Italian even though I have some solid reasons for learning Spanish was tough. And making the switch got me thinking: since I\u0026rsquo;m learning multiple languages, how should I decide which ones to focus on at any given point? When is it okay to switch?\nThe short answer: It\u0026rsquo;s fine to switch to follow motivation. Life is not a contract signed in blood that a demon is going to show up to enforce every time you stray from your original plans.\nNormalize stopping to learn a language because of changing priorities and goals ü§ó dabbling is ok üåº\n\u0026mdash; Lindie Botes ‚ú¶ Î¶∞Îîî ‚Ä¢ Áê≥Ëø™ (@lindiebee) October 5, 2020  Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a bit more to it than that. It\u0026rsquo;s true that hopping around too frequently can mean you end up dabbling in a lot of languages but never learning any of them to the standards you set for yourself (read that again!). As a solution to this problem, I\u0026rsquo;m trying out a strategy of making short-term commitments with end-dates. The idea is that this will allow me to make a satisfying chunk of progress while still leaving room to respond to my motivation and current situation.\nThink about what makes sense now I took Mandarin courses in middle school. Back then, I was enthralled by the language and couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine ever abandoning it. Fast-forward 10 years and I can think of 15 languages I\u0026rsquo;d rather learn before Mandarin.\nShould I force myself to learn it anyways? After all, I took 2 years of Mandarin when I was a preteen, and I promised myself I\u0026rsquo;d learn the language back then. It was a goal! I need to follow through!\n\u0026hellip; ridiculous, right?\nGoals change. Life changes. It\u0026rsquo;s great to have some vision for the future, but priorities shift and we need to be real about that.\nSpanish is appealing to me mostly for three reasons: language aesthetics, size of native speaker community, and the fact that I used to be okay at it in high school.\nOk, I\u0026rsquo;m also into Spanish because of the existence of Borges. 3.5 reasons.\nUntil recently, those 3.5 reasons kept me more motivated for Spanish than for Italian. But my situation has changed and now there are some reasons it makes sense for me to focus on Italian instead.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;m moving to Austria soon. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of Austro-Italo exchange since Austria borders Italy, and I can easily imagine spending time in Italy since it\u0026rsquo;ll be so close by. Second, my mom recently decided that she may want to retire in Italy. If she actually wants to do that, me learning Italian could make a huge difference when it comes to making that dream actually possible.\nI really value learning languages that I think I\u0026rsquo;ll actually use, so these two factors really pushed my motivation for Italian beyond my motivation for Spanish. Finding an incredible tutor, discovering that Italian just sounds awesome, and finding some really great beginners resources just threw a cherry on top.\nSwitching to Italian was a response to my current situation ‚Äî including soft factors like motivation. And I think we should always choose languages to learn based on where we are now rather than where when we set goals in the past.\nTaking a break is fine. Your other target languages aren\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere\u0026hellip; unless they are. Keeping track of your \u0026ldquo;current situation\u0026rdquo; also includes making the best of time-limited special opportunities to learn one of your target languages like being in the country or taking a university course. Switching back to Spanish in the middle of an Italy trip might not be worth it.\nMake a short-term commitment and know when your next chance to switch is coming So, how to actually put that rambling thought into practice?\nCommitting to a subset of your target languages for a defined period ‚Äî say a month or a quarter ‚Äî¬†might give you enough time to make a satisfying amount of progress without locking yourself into a language that isn\u0026rsquo;t sparking your interest for too long.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doing this with Italian now. I decided to stick with it until at least the beginning of April. That\u0026rsquo;s 3 months to focus on Italian, which I think should be enough to get to a point where I can understand a fair bit of what I hear in relatively straightforward authentic content ‚Äî¬†a nice point to reach even if I don\u0026rsquo;t go further. After those 3 months, I can decide if I want to go on with Italian for another chunk of time.\nWriting down the plan is helping me stick with it: I noted my intention to stick with Italian until at least the beginning of April in my digital goal-setting notebook (the Notion people finally got me). I also booked lessons with a tutor through the end of my Italian study period to keep me accountable.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all from me for this week. How do you handle dabbling and shifting motivations? Have you tried something like the short-term commitment suggestion I outline? Let me know what you think in the comments below.\nCiao!\n","date":"January 26, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/language-diary-1-somehow-we-re-back-to-italian/","tags":["Learn German","Learn Italian","Beginner language learning","Advanced language learning","Speakly"],"title":"Language Diary #1: Italian and making short-term language plans"},{"categories":["Language learning"],"contents":"I didn\u0026rsquo;t book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate level¬†(about B1 for you CEFR people).\nI used to think that it\u0026rsquo;d be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner. For me, working with tutors was always about practicing speech¬†‚Äî the only language skill I couldn\u0026rsquo;t learn alone. And why pay to talk to someone in your target language if you\u0026rsquo;re not ready to actually talk yet?\nThe few lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve taken in Spanish and Danish, two languages I\u0026rsquo;m not confident speaking in, didn\u0026rsquo;t convince me they were any more helpful than learning on my own. But recently, I started taking lessons in Italian, and working with my stellar Italian tutor completely changed my mind:\nIt can be worth it to work with a tutor as a total beginner ‚Äî¬†if you find the right teacher.\nWhy wait to hire a tutor? If you poll the language learning community, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear a range of opinions on whether tutors are worth it at the beginning (or at all). Waiting to start lessons worked well for me, and there certainly are good reasons to wait on hiring a language tutor until you reach an intermediate level.\nFirst, informal conversation lessons are generally cheaper than lessons for beginners. It takes more work and time to design lessons suitable for true beginners in a new language. Starting at an intermediate level means that you can opt for less expensive, informal conversation-based classes.\nLikewise, finding a tutor as a beginner can be more expensive. Community tutors ‚Äî tutors who are not certified second-language teachers ‚Äî on language tutoring marketplaces like iTalki often only offer informal conversation courses for intermediate and advanced students (some do teach beginners, though). Tutors who are confident guiding beginners from 0 to A1 are often certified teachers and therefore more expensive.\nMany of the things you need to learn as a beginner are easy to teach yourself for free, anyways. You can save yourself a nice chunk of cash by teaching yourself the basics.\nAnd finally ‚Äî and perhaps most controversially ‚Äî starting to speak too early might not be a great idea.\nMaybe don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;speak from day one\u0026rdquo; The jury is still out on whether \u0026ldquo;speaking from day one\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî an approach popularized among others by Irish polyglot Benny Lewis of Fluent in 3 Months fame ‚Äî¬†is a good idea. I tend to think it isn\u0026rsquo;t, and that a silent period is important, for two reasons:\nOne, I don\u0026rsquo;t think struggling through formulaic beginner conversations is necessarily the best use of your time at the beginning. At the start, learning a few basic grammar rules and a core vocabulary of a few hundred words will rapidly increase your comprehension. If your foreign language has a script that you need to learn before you can read, learning that early is critical. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine how spending a few hours struggling through basic conversations would be more useful than giving yourself the core toolkit you need for comprehension.\nSecond ‚Äî¬†and this is definitely controversial ‚Äî I think that speaking early can actually hinder learning, specifically by allowing you to practice incorrect speech and pronunciation. When you speak, you become your own \u0026ldquo;input.\u0026rdquo; And if you speak incorrectly, you are feeding yourself incorrect input. A silent period protects your brain from incorrect input for a while and gives you time to get a feel for your target language before you start using it and almost inevitably imposing your native language\u0026rsquo;s patterns and rules on it.\nHiring a tutor too early might give you the chance to speak and make mistakes that will stick with you as you improve and become hard to un-learn.\nHowever, I will caution here that a ‚Äúsilent period‚Äù in 2nd language acquisition by children isn‚Äôt even settled in the research yet, let alone in language-learning adults (Roberts 2014). Lots of polyglots swear by the speak-from-day-one approach, lots don\u0026rsquo;t. Do what feels right for you.\nHiring a tutor as a beginner can be very helpful ‚Äî if you find the right tutor All that being said, I recently had an amazing experience with an Italian tutor that changed my mind about starting lessons as a beginner. I now believe that a tutor can be worth it from day one\u0026hellip; but only if they\u0026rsquo;re the right tutor.\nInformal conversation practice isn\u0026rsquo;t enough Many tutors on sites like iTalki offer mostly informal conversation practice. This is fantastic, since it makes speaking practice available at a more accessible price, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal for beginners who can\u0026rsquo;t hold conversations yet (see reasons above).\nThe right tutor for a beginner offers more than informal conversation practice. They need to ‚Äî a true beginner can\u0026rsquo;t hold a conversation in their target language for 30 minutes or an hour.\nWhat a good tutor can do for beginners For me, a tutor is only \u0026ldquo;worth it\u0026rdquo; if working with them gives me something helpful I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get on my own.\nAt the intermediate level, that is speaking practice. At the beginner level, a skilled tutor can provide custom-tailored comprehensible input that teaches the things most relevant to you. They offer a window on the culture associated with your target language. And they can also do wonders for motivation.\nMy Italian tutor clearly plans our lessons around vocabulary that she anticipates will be relevant to me based on my iTalki profile and on what she learns about me during lessons. She modifies her speech so that I can understand it and so that it models the most common patterns I need to understand and communicate basic ideas in Italian. She recommends level-appropriate content in Italian for me to enjoy between lessons, and shares Italian culture with me as part of the lesson. She takes time to explain her approach and what she thinks I need to work on, which makes it easier for me to see the value her lessons bring me and understand if I\u0026rsquo;m making more progress with her than I would alone.\nHere are some things a great language tutor can do for a beginner:\n Modify their speech so that it serves as a kind of dynamic, totally customized comprehensible input perfect for your level Model the correct use of forms you need to learn during conversation Recommend level-appropriate content for comprehensible input Customize the lesson material to expose you to the words most relevant to you and your life first Help you understand your level and your weak points Be a source of accountability that keeps you consistent Motivate you and inspire your interest in the language  How to find the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; tutor as a beginner If you decide that you\u0026rsquo;d like to work with a tutor as a beginner, here are a few tips for finding one who will be a good fit.\nLook for someone who will show up with a lesson planned As a beginner, holding your own in a conversation lesson is a challenge\u0026hellip; a challenge I\u0026rsquo;m not totally convinced is worth at all. I know people do it, but I can think of many better things to do with 30 minutes to an hour as a beginner (learning core vocabulary, bare bones grammar, and scripts) than struggling through formulaic beginner dialogues. A tutor with a plan, however, can really make the best use of your time.\nKeep an eye out for tutors who use materials like images, slides, documents, videos, discussion prompts, etc. to structure lessons and who obviously have a plan for what to do with your time together. You should feel like you\u0026rsquo;re making more progress with your tutor than you would alone, and never have to struggle to come up with something to talk about or focus on during lessons yourself.\nMessage your tutor first to introduce yourself and ask if they take beginners This seems obvious, but it\u0026rsquo;s been helpful for me in the past. If a tutor\u0026rsquo;s profile or pricing intrigues you but you\u0026rsquo;re not sure if they take beginners, it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to ask. Providing a bit of information about yourself helps tutors customize lessons for you, too.\nTake advantage of trial lesson prices and shop around When you hire a tutor, you are not signing a blood contract binding you together forever. You\u0026rsquo;re free to move on and find someone else, or simply to shop around a bit before choosing one or two people to work with more consistently.\nTrial lessons are often cheaper than standard lessons and they\u0026rsquo;re a good chance to get to know tutors. Take advantage of them, and keep an eye out for signs that your teacher knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing with beginners:\n Has a lesson plan prepared before you show up Uses materials like slideshows and documents to aide learning Gives you individual feedback, esp. written down for later reference Customizes lessons so you learn the words you actually need first Simplifies their speech to provide you with comprehensible input Helps you find media in the language that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in Excites you about learning the language \u0026ldquo;Feels\u0026rdquo; correct ‚Äî a good fit is sometimes a gut feeling  Consider hiring a certified teacher There are certainly amazing community tutors out there who do great work with beginners. But if you want a safe bet that someone has experience working with beginners and can offer more than casual conversation, consider working with a certified teacher at the beginning. My current Italian tutor on iTalki is a certified teacher and she\u0026rsquo;s fantastic.\nIf certified teachers are too expensive for you long-term, booking lessons for your first month or two and then switching to a community tutor for conversation lessons could be a good compromise.\nThe bottom line: beginners should wait on casual conversation lessons, but can benefit from good tutors If you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner to your target language, I recommend that you wait on casual conversation lessons until you can actually hold a casual conversation ‚Äî¬†imperfectly, of course, but at least mostly without defaulting to your native language.\nBut finding the right tutor early on can be helpful. A good tutor can provide you with targeted comprehensible input ‚Äî including their speech ‚Äî that\u0026rsquo;s appropriate for your level. They can customize lessons to you, your needs, and your interests so that you learn what you specifically need first and skip things that you don\u0026rsquo;t need as often in the beginning. A good tutor can also add a source of accountability to your learning and inspire your love for the language ‚Äî¬†something that will help you learn more between your lessons no matter what you focus on together with your tutor.\nJust make sure you shop around to find the right tutor for you.\n","date":"January 22, 2022","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/is-it-worth-hiring-a-language-tutor-as-a-beginner/","tags":["Beginner language learning","Teach yourself a language","Language learning tips"],"title":"Is it worth hiring a language tutor as a beginner?"},{"categories":["Language Learning","Reviews"],"contents":"If you\u0026rsquo;re a language nerd like me, you probably waste hours reading books about languages that you could have spent actually learning one. And now you\u0026rsquo;re reading a review about a book about language learning instead of actually learning a language. So it goes.\nAnyhow, this is my first book review for the blog. Let me know what you like ‚Äî¬†and especially what you don\u0026rsquo;t like ‚Äî¬†so the next one can be better.\nNote: I was given a free ebook copy of The Language Secret by its author for review.\nThe Language Secret by John Stedman The subtitle of the book is \u0026ldquo;How to speak 10 languages badly\u0026quot;and if that\u0026rsquo;s your goal (and if those 10 languages are Romance and Germanic languages), you will find a lot to love in The Language Secret.\nHowever, the book misses the mark with its purported target audience‚Äîanglophone monoglots learning their first new language. The main takeaways get buried under jokes and pop-culture references and actionable \u0026ldquo;do this, not that, then do this\u0026rdquo; instructions are few and far between.\nThe Language Secret by John Stedman\nRating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ\nPrice: $9.99 (Kindle), $19.99 (Paperback), $29.99 (Hardcover) [Amazon]\nTLDR: Outstanding for #langtwt types trying to learn 15 languages, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give it to my monolingual mom who just wants to learn Italian\nThe good:\n Thoroughly anti-perfectionist Lots of \u0026ldquo;lightbulb\u0026rdquo; moments for experienced learners Sections on the Romance and Germanic languages useful for anglophones who want to learn multiple languages at once  The bad:\n Often lacks of clear, actionable instructions Takeaways get buried under references and quips Recommended vocabulary learning technique requires a partner  The ugly:\n Rambling introductions drove me insane. But that\u0026rsquo;s just me.    What is \u0026ldquo;The Language Secret\u0026rdquo; anyways? The eponymous \u0026ldquo;Language Secret\u0026rdquo; of The Language Secret is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.\nAs language secrets go, I think this is a great one ‚Äî an anti-perfectionism mantra I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep in my subconscious back-pocket for every time I encounter another person who keeps perfectly calligraphed bullet journals and actually uses Toggl.\n The eponymous \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; of The Language Secret is this: to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly.\n Learning to be okay with being bad at stuff is a skill, and an important one for language learners. The fact is, most adult learners will never achieve native-like fluency (Lightbown 2000). And if it\u0026rsquo;s unusual ‚Äî read: vanishingly rare ‚Äî for adult language learners to achieve native-like fluency in a new language, there is no chance that you won\u0026rsquo;t suck at the beginning.\nShould that hold you back? Absolutely not. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I think Stedman\u0026rsquo;s anti-perfectionist \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; is some of the best language learning advice you could ask for.\nShould \u0026ldquo;speaking badly\u0026rdquo; really involve speaking? In defense of a silent period   With its call to \u0026ldquo;speak badly\u0026rdquo; and specific advice aimed at starting to speak as quickly as possible ‚Äî including knowingly ignoring proper grammar and using easier-to-learn, but incorrect work-arounds instead ‚Äî The Language Secret falls firmly into the speak-from-day-one √° la Benny Lewis camp.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that very early speaking is helpful‚Äîor even that it isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German badly, at least not in the way Stedman suggests, in a sort of \u0026ldquo;me, Tarzan\u0026rdquo; way. After about a year of soaking in comprehensible input, I started speaking at about a B1 level. Because of this, I never had the chance to develop bad habits at A1 that could follow me to B1.\nStill, the existence of a true \u0026ldquo;silent period\u0026rdquo; in 2nd language acquisition by children isn\u0026rsquo;t even settled in the research yet, let alone in language-learning adults (Roberts 2014). And at the end of the day, Stedman is the polyglot, not I. Go forth and speak badly if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want to do.\n  And really, if you really need to be able to achieve perfect mastery over something to find it fulfilling, language learning is not for you. Find a hobby you can master, like solving Rubik\u0026rsquo;s cubes.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah-hah\u0026rdquo; moments for experienced learners Beyond its refreshing anti-perfectionism, Stedman\u0026rsquo;s book shines as a soft introduction to a few important ideas from linguistics that can be illuminating for language learners. If you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced learner who hasn\u0026rsquo;t already encountered these ideas, The Language Secret will set off lightbulbs left and right for you.\nThis is especially true if you\u0026rsquo;re studying or have ever studied a Germanic or Romance language. The two chapters on these language families do a good job of providing a \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; for many of the most important patterns and quirks of these popular languages.\nBut even if you\u0026rsquo;re studying Russian or Thai, the sections on grammar, idiom, register, and language families in general will all offer helpful insights. Anglophones, in particular, will benefit from the chapter on grammar which points out many of the patterns in English that tend to break down in other languages.\nIf you like learning a little bit of lots of languages, this book is for you I see a lot of people interested in many, many languages in the language learning corners of the internet. Look at people\u0026rsquo;s Twitter bios and you\u0026rsquo;ll see 13 different flags indicating their target languages.\nIf that sounds like you, The Language Secret can probably help you gain a rough understanding of many languages that you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for. The chapters on language families are intended to show how you can acquire basic vocabulary and grammar in many sister languages at once.\nNot the best book for first-time learners While I think experienced (and perhaps very motivated) learners can get a lot out of The Language Secret, I would not recommend this book to beginners.\nThe alternate title of the book is \u0026ldquo;How to speak 10 languages badly.\u0026rdquo; If that\u0026rsquo;s what you want, read the book. If you\u0026rsquo;re a monoglot just trying to learn Spanish, I suspect that you might leave Stedman\u0026rsquo;s tome a bit more confused than you came into it.\nThe important points get buried under excessive quips and references Unfortunately, The Language Secret buries most of its helpful points under a heap of unnecessary verbiage and indulgent references to pop-culture and history. And instead of providing clear instructions or highlighting the main points succinctly, it waxes sarcastic to indulge in line upon line of what I can only describe as very British humor. To get a sense of what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, look at the chapter titles in thenext section.\nThis, in my view, makes the book almost unusable for beginners.\nIf you already have an idea of how to learn a language, the quips and random references could be fun icing on information you can take and incorporate into your existing learning practices. But for total newbies, the book does not offer clear enough directions. Loads of information is provided, but the \u0026ldquo;so what\u0026rdquo; is often missing.\nEach chapter begins with a few (ebook) pages devoted to a story that is in most cases only tangentially related to the topics at hand. References to that story will then show up over, and over, and over again throughout the chapter ‚Äî alongside new references to other things that you may or may not have ever heard of before or care about.\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s my journalism experience (\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t bury the lede!\u0026quot;), but I found the references and extremely quippy tone excessive. And irritating. It especially bothered me that reference-laden quips took the place of bullet-points with the main takeaways at the end of each chapter.\nSuggested learning methods can be a tad out of touch My final bone to pick with The Language Secret is that the few specific methods it does suggest are often a bit out of touch.\nThe book doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to recognize that digital tools other than Google Translate and Duolingo exist. The section on spaced repetition doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention Anki, Memrise, or any of the other popular spaced repetition programs used widely in the language community.\nInstead of introducing Anki, The Language Secret suggests that you make paper flashcards and have a friend (in practice, I assume, romantic partner) drill you on them daily. The method outlined wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible to do using the cards on your own.\nFor pronunciation, the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t suggest shadowing or comprehensible input or even much listening ‚Äî¬†it suggests using the IPA. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, but I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the book specifying how exactly one should use the IPA to learn pronunciation.\nChapter breakdown The Language Secret is divided into an introduction, conclusion, and 10 chapters. Below are quick breakdowns of each of the 10 chapters. As you can see, the book covers a lot of ground!\nA quick note: I\u0026rsquo;ve introduced each chapter under my own \u0026ldquo;translated\u0026rdquo; titles. The real titles (provided below each \u0026ldquo;translation\u0026rdquo;) each consist of title, a subtitle, and a sub-subtitle and were a bit too long to look nice on the blog, so I summarized.\nChapter 1: The 4 Core Language Skills ‚Äî Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing Original Title: \u0026ldquo;The Birmingham Screwdriver: In Which We Find Out How to Get Started and Use the Right Tools for the Job: What is Involved in Learning a Language and How Long It Takes\u0026rdquo;\n The 4 core language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing Each skill needs to be learned using a different method (contrast with the Input Hypothesis, which holds that all skills are learned by receiving comprehensible input alone) The \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî don\u0026rsquo;t be a perfectionist!

For all of my frustration with this book\u0026rsquo;s tone and my recommendation that first-time learners skip it, The Language Secret is still a book I plan on recommending to a lot of people.\nUnlike many of the polyglot books I\u0026rsquo;ve come across, it\u0026rsquo;s honest and doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to convince you that if you just buy or do one thing, you\u0026rsquo;ll suddenly be fluent in a new language. It\u0026rsquo;s up-front about the work it takes to learn a language and honest about the factors beyond your control that can make it easier or harder. And it\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating look at the \u0026ldquo;everyday multilingualism\u0026rdquo; that exists in much of the world.\nInstead of focusing on the practical specifics of language learning, The Language Secret zooms out to offer an overview of many of the important concepts underpinning language and language learning, especially language families. Pick it up if you want to learn multiple languages and can handle a bit of rambling. Pass if you\u0026rsquo;re a newbie\u0026hellip; but consider coming back to it later, when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\nAnd do remember the \u0026ldquo;language secret\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî to speak a language well, you first have to speak it badly!\n","date":"December 20, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/book-review-the-language-secret/","tags":["Language learning books","Language resources","Book Reviews","Teach yourself a language"],"title":"Book Review: The Language Secret by John Stedman"},{"categories":["German","Language learning"],"contents":"Last week on Monday I officially went from monoglot to\u0026hellip; duo-glot? Bilingual sounds wrong. I didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up speaking two languages.\nAnyways, as a newly minted official Goethe Institute certified B2 German speaker, I wanted to stop and share how I prepped for the test‚Äîand really, how I didn\u0026rsquo;t prep for the test.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of advice out there for test-takers that I fundamentally disagree with. As always, it seems the consensus is that you need to execute some kind of hardcore bootcamp to do well on the B2 Goethe exam.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s really just a big load of crap, because I barely \u0026ldquo;studied\u0026rdquo; and still earned a nearly perfect score.\nCramming isn\u0026rsquo;t the way. Period. If you\u0026rsquo;re actually a B2 German speaker, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to cram. And you can become a B2 German speaker without doing anything much more complicated than watching a bunch of TV and talking to people once in a while.\nI self-studied mostly using comprehensible input for 2 years 99.9999% of all of the work that goes into your exam grade should come before you even sign up for the exam. No amount of cramming can make you B2 in a month. For me, it took 2 years of self-study to reach B2. And it\u0026rsquo;s those 2 years‚Äînot the 2 weeks of prep I did for the exam‚Äîthat earned me great scores.\nNetflix, Spotify, and Duolingo will get you pretty far I overwhelmingly relied on comprehensible input to learn German. This sounds fancy, but in practice it meant watching loads of TV and listening to an unholy number of podcasts. Shout out to my mom for letting me leech off of her Netflix account all these years. You rock, Teri.\nComprehensible input is anything that you can understand in your target language. If n is your level, the best comprehensible input is n+1.\nNow, I jumped into German watching a lot of n+1000 content (looking at you, Dark on Netflix). But even if you\u0026rsquo;re stupid like me and refuse to use beginner resources you can still brute-force immersion yourself to fluency.\n I can now officially confirm that 2 years of mostly just watching TV can get you to B2 German ü•≥\n\u0026mdash; Elise likes languages (@monoglotanxiety) December 13, 2021   For the first year, I relied exclusively on Duolingo (to learn basic vocabulary) and comprehensible input (Netflix, YouTube, and podcasts on Spotify) to learn German.\nFind penpals and speaking partners once you can communicate a bit About a year in, when I hit something around a B1 level, I started trying to communicate with people. In practice, this meant chatting with an iTalki tutor about once every two weeks and writing to penpals. More recently, I found speaking partners to chat with occasionally via text and Skype.\nI use Slowly to find and write to penpals.\nI use HelloTalk and MyLanguageExchange.com to find speaking partners.\nI tested at my real level, not my reach level Take the exam at your real level, not your reach level. If you\u0026rsquo;re testing at the right level, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to prep much.\nI leafed through a C1 practice test, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that I could have passed C1‚Äîwith some serious prep. But why force it? I\u0026rsquo;m not a C1 speaker yet, even if I could fake it for an exam. I\u0026rsquo;ll pass C1 when I\u0026rsquo;m at C1.\nAnd if aren\u0026rsquo;t a B2 speaker yet but need the B2 certificate for something‚Äîlike studying at a German university‚Äîmaybe ask yourself if you\u0026rsquo;re really ready for whatever you need that certificate for. There\u0026rsquo;s no shame in waiting until you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go for B2.\nI DIDN\u0026rsquo;T cram Seriously, chill out. You do not need some kind of crazy 2-month study plan to prep for this test.\nI got a perfect score in speaking and writing, a 97% in reading, and a 93% in listening after a few weeks of relaxed exam prep. And I mean relaxed. I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 8 hours prepping over 2 weeks.\nOne of the girls taking the test with me told me a bit about the pre-exam study routines of YouTubers she followed and I just sat there blinking, nonplussed. People seriously do a practice exam a day for a month? Drill conjugations and vocabulary every day for two months? If that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;ll take to pass, why are you even taking the exam?\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fake it, make it. Take the exam you\u0026rsquo;re ready for and you won\u0026rsquo;t need to cram. Cramming doesn\u0026rsquo;t teach you anything long-term, it just inflates your level short-term.\nI spent a few weeks learning how to take the test Those 8 hours of prep were not devoted to learning new vocabulary or drilling grammar. I used them to learn how to take the test. The B2 Goethe exam is in B2 German, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test you on B2 German. It tests how well you can take the Goethe B2 German exam. So don\u0026rsquo;t prep your German, prep your test-taking.\nLike other standardized tests (e.g., the SAT, ACT, and GRE), the Goethe exam is much easier when you know what you\u0026rsquo;re walking into. Your ability to do well on tests like these often have a lot less to do with your mastery of the subject material than with your mastery of the test-taking format.\nEspecially for the speaking and writing sections, knowing what the graders will evaluate you on is critical. You could speak perfectly fluently and flunk just because your speech didn\u0026rsquo;t include a clear \u0026ldquo;beginning, middle, and end\u0026rdquo; as required.\n The B2 Goethe exam is in B2 German, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test you on B2 German. It tests how well you can take the test. So don\u0026rsquo;t prep your German, prep your test-taking.\n The good news is, you don\u0026rsquo;t need much time to learn the tasks the test will ask you to complete. A week or two is more than enough.\nI practiced the reading module once I know that I know how to read in German, so I only practiced the reading module one time. The point wasn\u0026rsquo;t to practice reading, the point was to get familiar with the kinds of questions the test asks. Basically: waste time reading the reading module instructions before the exam, not during the exam.\nIf you can read the news in German (which you should be able to do if you\u0026rsquo;re B2), one practice test to get familiar with exam format is more than enough prep for the reading module.\nI practiced the writing module a few times You\u0026rsquo;ll need to write two ~250 word writing samples for the Goethe B2 exam: an informal \u0026ldquo;forum post\u0026rdquo; and a formal email. For both tasks, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to structure formal arguments √° la high school 5-paragraph essay.\nHigh school essay transitions: the only phrases worth memorizing\nI\u0026rsquo;m against memorization. But you can easily be B2 and not know the stilted transition phrases that exam graders like to see in writing samples and speeches (gotta have that sweet, sweet \u0026ldquo;structure\u0026rdquo;). Having a few of these in your back pocket before the test will take off a bit of stress:\nMeiner Meinung nach\u0026hellip; (in my opinion \u0026hellip; )\nIch stimme \u0026hellip; nicht zu, da/weil \u0026hellip; (I disagree with \u0026hellip; , because \u0026hellip;)\nIch bin anderer Meinung (I have a different opinion)\nIch m√∂chte √ºber \u0026hellip; sprechen (I\u0026rsquo;d like to speak about \u0026hellip; )\nZum einen \u0026hellip; zum anderen \u0026hellip; (On the one hand \u0026hellip;, on the other \u0026hellip; )\nZum Abschluss \u0026hellip; (In conclusion \u0026hellip; )\nDanke f√ºr Ihre Aufmerksamkeit (Thank you for your attention)\nAnd don\u0026rsquo;t forget the address (Sehr verehrte Frau/Herr Lastname) and sign-off (Mit herzlichen Gr√º√üen) for formal emails!\n  I recommend practicing these unnatural exercises a few times so they don\u0026rsquo;t trip you up. And remember to write by hand. When is the last time you wrote hundreds of words by hand? On paper? In ink? Do you even know what a 100-word chunk of your own handwriting looks like?\nI practiced the speaking module a few times If I asked you to deliver a 4-minute speech on say, \u0026ldquo;living in old age\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sustainable tourism\u0026rdquo; in your native language right now, could you do it? Would it have a clear beginning, middle, and end? Structured arguments? A list of possibilities with pros and cons for each, and one possibility described in more detail?\nNo? Yeah, me neither. But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to do for the Goethe B2 speaking module.\nThe other task is a bit less awkward ‚Äî it\u0026rsquo;s a 5-minute discussion with another test taker based on a prompt. Having a conversation feels a lot more natural than giving a speech.\nWhat about the listening module?\nSo, see, I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually practice the listening module at all. I consider listening my strongest skill so I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother practicing the listening module.\nThat was a mistake. I still did well, but my 93% in listening was my lowest score. The listening exercises were really unnatural for me since I\u0026rsquo;m used to listening to full conversations and not 1-3 contextless sentences floating in the void. Don\u0026rsquo;t be like me ‚Äî download that audio file and do the listening module once to get used to it, just like the reading module.\n  I practiced using the formal-you (Sie) So, I never siezen (use the formal-you for) anybody. I\u0026rsquo;m self-taught and only ever speak to my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family, speaking partners, and tutors around my age. So going into the test, I knew that remembering to use Sie would potentially trip me up on the exam.\nTo practice, I chatted a bit with my boyfriend and my German tutor using Sie in the week before the test.\nOf course, I still messed this up on my exam. But the test proctors didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to mind¬†‚Äî I scored 100% in speaking. Which brings me to my next point\u0026hellip;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to be perfect to do well on the B2 German exam Surprised? I was too. But I looked at the grading rubrics for the exam and realized that a 60% was enough to pass each module. Keeping that in mind helped me keep calm ‚Äî and keep paralyzing perfectionism at bay.\nFor the speaking and writing modules, the best possible score you can achieve still allows for occasional mistakes that don\u0026rsquo;t interfere with understanding. For the 30-question multiple-choice reading and listening sections, you can miss 10 questions and still pass.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a lot of leeway. Don\u0026rsquo;t freak out if you don\u0026rsquo;t know an answer, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Mistakes are allowed, even for perfect scores. Check out the grading rubric to see for yourself.\nSpeaking mistakes are a chance to show off your German And on a related note‚Äîif you screw up speaking, your mistake can actually be a chance to guide the conversation towards topics you\u0026rsquo;re more confident speaking about.\nMy speaking partner was high school student, so I went into the conversation 100% expecting to duzen her. But she spoke first and addressed me with Sie, so it would have technically be impolite for me to duzen her back. Needless to say, I slipped up and duzen-ed her multiple times.\nAfter my first slip-up, I stopped in my tracks and turned to the proctors to explain that I\u0026rsquo;ve rarely had to siezen anyone since I mostly speak German with my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family, and that I especially wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to siezen-ing folks my age since I\u0026rsquo;m self-taught.\nExplaining my mistake was a chance to speak fluently about something I was used to talking about‚Äîin my case, my boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s family and teaching myself German.\nSo, prepare a few stock explanations for mistakes you\u0026rsquo;re likely to make. Screw up a word\u0026rsquo;s gender? Explain that you heard it in a YouTube video and never learned its gender. Don\u0026rsquo;t know the translation of \u0026ldquo;House of Representatives?\u0026rdquo; Sorry, you mostly listen to German podcasts about science or art, not US politics. The topic selection was unlucky. Siezen where you should duzen? Whoops, you were just trying to be polite.\nThe takeaway: you don\u0026rsquo;t need to study hard to pass the B2 German exam If you read my blog or follow me on Twitter, you know what\u0026rsquo;s coming next: you don\u0026rsquo;t need some kind of perfectly planned, perfectly executed study plan to ace the B2 German test. A few years of (lots and lots of) comprehensible input supplemented with a bit of speaking and writing practice once you can communicate reasonably well and a week or two of prepping for the exam itself before the test will get you there.\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t stress. Just head over to Netflix and watch another episode of Dark. Or whatever you like watching. That\u0026rsquo;ll help you far more than any hardcore cram-session.\n","date":"December 19, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/how-i-passed-the-goethe-b2-german-exam-with-a-nearly-perfect-score/","tags":["German exam","Language learning tips","Learn German"],"title":"How I Passed the Goethe B2 German Exam With a Nearly Perfect Score"},{"categories":["Language Learning"],"contents":"Writing is one of my favorite ways to actively study German. It is great for vocabulary building and grammar practice, and in the absence of speaking opportunities, it is the only way to get practice with production skills. But beyond simply being a great way to practice on its own, writing is a key component of how I use flashcards and spaced repetition to learn German. In this post, I break down how to use writing practice to get more out of spaced repetition systems like Anki.\nTLDR: Combine Anki or another SRS with writing practice for better flashcards\nBy integrating an SRS into your writing practice, you can learn and remember the grammar, vocabulary, etc. that you struggle with most and avoid wasting time studying things you already know. Simply write in your target language, make mistakes while writing, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards to use with an SRS like Anki. If you use Anki, a simple and fast way to make \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is to make cloze deletions based on the corrected sentence.\n  Spaced repetition is a well-studied learning method, and a large body of evidence backs up the claims of the many language bloggers and internet polyglots who tout its benefits. Most modern language learning tools are based on a spaced repetition system (SRS) under the hood, so if you\u0026rsquo;re using Duolingo or Memrise study a language, you\u0026rsquo;ve already have gotten a taste of what spaced repetition is about.\nI use Anki for all of my language flashcards because it is free and very flexible‚Äîit works just as well for med students cramming for the MCAT as it does for me as a German learner. This flexibility extends to templating and allows for fun things like automatic color-coding if you hate yourself enough to write out the JavaScript. Check out my Anki templates and decks if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. They\u0026rsquo;re all free.\nWhen used well, an SRS like Anki can be incredibly helpful because it helps you to move concepts from short-term into long-term memory very efficiently, which is exactly what serious language learners need. But using an SRS doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can abandon other study methods. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the most success using Anki when I combine it with other study methods‚Äîespecially writing.\nThree rules for a healthy flashcard diet The tricky thing about using an SRS like Anki is that it needs to be fed properly. If you use your SRS consistently, you\u0026rsquo;ll remember pretty much everything in your decks. This open-endedness makes SRSs flexible enough to help you learn everything from German verb forms to the bones of the hand, but comes with a downside: Anki doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about what you learn, it just cares that you learn. If you study an unhelpful deck, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn unhelpful things.\nWhat a healthy flashcard diet looks like will be different depending on your needs. But regardless what you\u0026rsquo;re learning, good flashcards will tend to adhere to two basic principles: novelty and relevance.\n Novelty: Flashcards should teach us something we don\u0026rsquo;t already know well Relevance: Flashcards should teach us something useful Simplicity: Flashcards should ask clear \u0026ldquo;questions\u0026rdquo; with straightforward answers (See: minimum information principle)  Adhering to novelty, relevance, and simplicity will help you get more out of your SRS whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner learning your first words or a veteran of the B2-plateau like me who needs to focus more on grammar, usage, and more obscure vocab. Incidentally, you can apply these \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; just as well to topics other than language. So go memorize your amino acids or whatever else you\u0026rsquo;re procrastinating on by reading this post.\nBut how to make sure your deck is novel, relevant, and simple?\nI know that there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a split among the langosphere giants when it comes to whether it\u0026rsquo;s best to make your own flashcards or use pre-made decks to save time. And then of course there\u0026rsquo;s the anti-flashcard crowd, but I don\u0026rsquo;t negotiate with terrorists so I won\u0026rsquo;t address any of their points here. I\u0026rsquo;m no polyglot, but my unqualified opinion tends to fall on the make-your-own-flashcards side of the debate, if only for one reason:\nMaking your own flashcards is a good way to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re learning novel and relevant cards.\nThere are some great ready-made flashcard decks out there that, depending on your needs, might already check all three boxes for you. This is especially true for beginners, who often need to learn the same set of core vocabulary when they\u0026rsquo;re just starting out. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve made a bit of progress, the relevance and novelty of ready-made decks falls off fast unless you have a good way of filtering through them. It is very easy to waste time \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; things you either don\u0026rsquo;t need or already know when using decks made by others.\nThis is why making your own flashcards can be so helpful. When you make a deck yourself, you have more control over your flashcard diet.\nThe chicken-and-egg problem of making good flashcards Unfortunately, making good flashcards presents something of a chicken-and-egg problem. Simplicity is usually pretty easy to recognize in cards. If you can\u0026rsquo;t tell what a flashcard is asking you or the answer is complicated enough that you keep getting parts of it right and parts of it wrong, then the card isn\u0026rsquo;t simple enough. But what about novelty and relevance?\nNovel, relevant cards teach us things that we need to learn but don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about something, how can you know whether it is relevant or not? And worse, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know that a certain word or grammar concept exists‚Äîeven if it might be very relevant to you‚Äîhow can you know to put it on a flashcard?\nLanguage teachers and courses exist to address these problems. Their job is quite literally to decide what novel information is most relevant for learners at various stages.\nBut language teachers and courses can be expensive or inaccessible. And often, the kind of de-facto \u0026ldquo;relevance\u0026rdquo; imposed by quizzes and sets of vocabulary and grammar topics grouped by chapter/module doesn\u0026rsquo;t align well with real relevance‚Äîyou could easily end up learning the names of 15 family members you don\u0026rsquo;t have instead of picking up a grammar concept that could move you closer to your specific language goals.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that there\u0026rsquo;s no place for teachers or textbooks iny our learning plan. There probably is a place for them. Their place just isn\u0026rsquo;t dictating 100% of the contents of your flashcard deck.\nWrite in your target language and turn your mistakes into flashcards It would be absurd to sit down and attempt to plan out the content for your cards in advance. Not only would you risk getting caught up in the chicken-and-egg problem, but you\u0026rsquo;d probably also waste a ton of time. Flashcards are just one tool for language learning and, ideally, making them shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a chore that siphons time away from language learning.\nNo, instead of playing teacher and attempting to design a custom curriculum for yourself, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to simply let your flashcards emerge organically as you use your target language. And the best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this is to write.\nWrite, get your writing corrected by a native speaker, and turn your mistakes into flashcards.\nWriting preserves our mistakes clearly in text. When we set down a book or finish a show in our target language, we aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a printed-out list of words and phrases that we didn\u0026rsquo;t understand while reading or watching. And while speaking in a new language is notoriously intimidating, it is also more forgiving than writing: when we speak, our mistakes disappear as soon as we stop speaking. But whatever we write has the potential to stick around‚Äîmistakes and all‚Äîfor as long as the paper it was written on or file it was saved in exists.\nThis can make writing intimidating, but it also makes it incredibly useful. Because writing records our mistakes, we can use writing practice as a kind of compass that points towards the grammar and vocabulary you need to learn or review and allows you to avoid wasting time wandering through topics you already understand well.\nCombining writing with an SRS allows your flashcards to emerge organically. Your decks will grow with you, naturally reflecting the way you use your target language and the topics you need the most help learning. If you made a mistake on something, odds are that you don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand it yet. Novelty, check. And the fact that you tried to use it at all indicates that it would have been useful for you to know better. Relevance, check.\nTip: Use cloze deletion to quickly turn mistakes into flashcards\nThe most helpful format that I\u0026rsquo;ve found for \u0026ldquo;mistake cards\u0026rdquo; is also one of the easiest to make: cloze deletions. Cloze deletions are essentially fill-in-the-blank questions. The front of a card has a sentence or other text with some element(s) removed and replaced with a placeholder [‚Ä¶]. The back of the card is the whole sentence without deletions.\n  Getting your writing corrected by native speakers is easy these days. Here are a few different places to look for corrections. Most are free!\n LangCorrect (free). Correction exchange, usually fast feedback. My go-to. Language subreddits (free). I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German. There are writing-specific subs for some languages as well, like r/WriteStreakGerman. Twitter (free). Certain Twitter communities are full of language learners that are happy to help with requests. Check out #langtwt to find people interested in language who speak your target language. iTalki tutors (cheap). Many will proofread outside of lesson time for a low price per page, just ask. Teachers (only if you\u0026rsquo;re in a course already). If you\u0026rsquo;re taking a class, just use your corrected writing assignments to make flashcards.  When it comes to actually making cards out of mistakes, I usually use cloze deletions. Thes are a sort of fill-in-the-blank style flashcard that is very quick to make. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a mistake card I made recently based on corrections from LangCorrect:\nNote that I clozed both adjective endings here. If I had only clozed one, the card would ask a different \u0026ldquo;question\u0026rdquo; than it does currently. The mistake I originally made was knowing whether Wort was neuter or masculine, not whether the adjective endings of gut and deutsch were the same. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give myself too much of a hint by leaving the -es ending on one of the two adjectives, I clozed both endings.\nI mention this just as an example of how you might think about creating your own cards. Be sure to test the mistake you actually made, not a mistake you didn\u0026rsquo;t (even if the card would be a tad simpler that way).\nExample: How I combine writing practice with Anki to make better German flashcards In case you\u0026rsquo;re interested in seeing a concrete implementation of this idea, here\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated Anki into my writing practice:\n Each day, I try (often unsuccessfully) to set aside 30 minutes to write in German. I usually respond to a prompt I find online, or just complain about something that upset me recently. Then I submit my writing to LangCorrect for corrections by native speakers. I usually correct 1-2 submissions by English learners while I\u0026rsquo;m at it to give back and improve the chances that my writing is corrected quickly. Sometimes, I meet with a German tutor on iTalki during the week and we correct a written homework assignment, so I get writing corrections that way as well. Once I get corrections back, I go through them and turn each correction into a flashcard. This is as simple as copy-pasting the corrected sentence into an Anki cloze card and clozing the bits I screwed up. If necessary, I add a hint or translation to the card, but usually the sentence provides enough context on its own.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s so simple that I wonder now how I managed to write this much about it. That\u0026rsquo;s blogging for you.\n","date":"April 15, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/spaced-repetition-writing/","tags":["anki","language learning tips"],"title":"How to  make better language flashcards by combining writing practice with spaced repetition"},{"categories":["Language Learning","German"],"contents":"German science videos were some of the first \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; German media that I could understand. It might sound like a tough place to start, but thanks to the overlap between English and German scienctific vocabulary, science videos can actually be a great entry into authentic German content (especially if you\u0026rsquo;re a nerd like me). These 10 channels are a great resource for German learners or anyone else looking for awesome science videos in German.\nMany of these channels are supported by German public broadcasters like ZDF, so you can look forward to plenty of ad-free immersion.\nWith that, I hope you nerds enjoy!!\n1. Mailab One of the most famous German-language YouTube channels, Mailab was my gateway drug for German science YouTube. The host, Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim, earned her PhD in chemistry before becoming a full-time science communicator and YouTuber. Her videos cover a wide range of scientific topics relevant to daily life, and she often debunks popular science myths. As a scientist myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been amazed by how clearly Mai communicates complex ideas‚Äînot just about science, but about the scientific process as well‚Äîwithout sacrificing accuracy.\nHer video on why and how scientists make mistakes and what that really means the best treatment of this issue tjat I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to find on YouTube‚Äîin German or English‚Äîto date.\n2. Dinge Erkl√§rt (Kurzgesagt) You might already be familiar with the insanely popular (14+ million subscriber) science and philosophy channel Kurzgesagt, but did you realize that there\u0026rsquo;s a German-language Kurzgesagt channel, too? In fact, the studio behind Kurzgesagt is based in Munich, so you might even consider the German-language channel the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; Kurzgesagt (even though it was started 2 years later and has about 8% of the subscribers).\nMany videos are simply German versions of those on the English channel, but there are a few that are exclusive to one language or the other. This video on homeopathy isn\u0026rsquo;t available in English, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great look at a pretty hot-button issue in Germany.\n3. Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co Terra X, a brand associated with the German public broadcaster ZDF, is essentially the German version of the Discovery Channel‚Ä¶if the Discovery Channel was still producing educational documentaries instead of overproduced docu-series about dudes with weird or dangerous jobs. There are 3 Terra X channels on YouTube, my favorite being Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co.\nLesch\u0026amp;Co is one of the two science-focused arms of the Terra X channel trio, with content made with a more grown-up audience in mind than counterpart Terra X plus. Most of the videos are about physics and astronomy, perhaps because the main host, Harald Lesch, is a walking, talking stereotype of a physicist‚Äîsweatervests and all. It\u0026rsquo;s a great channel with interesting videos and a dynamic team of co-hosts including Mai Nguyen-Kim of Mailab.\nFor the classic Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co astrophysics-y experience, check out the playlist \u0026ldquo;Das Weltall erkl√§rt.\u0026quot;\nWant more German YouTube channels and other media?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more German YouTube channels, I write a little newsletter that offers up a new recommendaiton for German YouTube channels, movies, TV, music, podcasts, books, and more each week. It\u0026rsquo;s completely free. You can also check out the archives to see all of the past recommendations without signing up.\n  4. Terra X plus Like sister channel Terra X Lesch\u0026amp;Co, Terra X plus is a science channel from ZDF. The content is intended for school kids and teens, so this channel might be a better choice than Lesch\u0026amp;Co you\u0026rsquo;re just starting to learn German.\nUnlike a lot of science channels, this one doesn\u0026rsquo;t just stick to astrophysics. There\u0026rsquo;s biology, too, like this video on how trees communicate with one another.\n5. Quarks A well-known German science and technology show, but Quarks has kept up with the 21st century trends by making a YouTube channel as well. If you like any of the TerraX channels, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably enjoy Quarks as well. The channel has tons of videos on scientific topics (especially those relevant to everyday life, society and politics) and there are plenty of interesting science history and natural history videos as well.\nI really enjoyed what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far of the \u0026ldquo;Die Geschichte von‚Ä¶\u0026rdquo; series, which isn\u0026rsquo;t always about science but is exactly the kind of thing I remember loving to watch on the Discovery Channel as a kid.\n6. BYTEthinks For the more technically inclined, BYTEthinks is a YouTube channel full of short, byte-sized (haha) videos on technology and science. The video style is fun, mostly consisting of stick-figure style animations and virtual chalkboard diagrams that help clarify complex topics. The channel definitely has a focus on computer science.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? Try BYTEthinks' video on artificial intelligence.\n7. Psychologeek Psychology, like many social sciences, often falls victim to twisted interpretation that can lead to persistent, wrong, and sometimes harmful scientific myths. Psychologeek host and psychologist Pia Kabitzsch does a great job breaking down the real science behind popular psychology topics for a wide audience and, when necessary, debunking those pesky myths.\nI loved her video on the ever-popular Myers-Briggs personality types. Decide for yourself whether to file those under psychology fact or potentially harmful myth.\n8. Explainity Explainity isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a science channel‚Äìit\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;education project\u0026rdquo; with videos on pretty much anyting complicated enough to require a bit of explaining. The hand-drawn video style is super engaging, and there are plenty of videos on natural science and medicine in addition to Explanity\u0026rsquo;s fantastic content on German politics and society.\nThe video on photosynthesis does a great job walknig through not only the science involved, but also the history behind how photosynthesis was descovered.\n9. AllesPhysik AllesPhysik is a straightforward physics and astronomy YouTube channel. If you liked Cosmos, you might like this: the channel\u0026rsquo;s creator, Thomas, has made almost 20 videos so far on the solar system, space exploration, and the cosmology. Videos are usually short, no more than 10 minutes, so you can definitely squeeze in a bit of German practice with AllesPhysik even if you\u0026rsquo;re pressed for time.\nAllesPhysik\u0026rsquo;s latest video was on discovering habitable exoplants.\n10. Terra X Rounding out the Terra X trio and this list of German science YouTube channels is Terra X (no \u0026ldquo;plus,\u0026rdquo; no \u0026ldquo;Lesch\u0026amp;Co\u0026rdquo;) . It comes in last of the three since it has more of a historical than scientific bent, but there are plenty of good cosmology, earth history, and archaeology videos on the channel as well.\nThe playlist on spaceflight is a good place to look for science videos on this channel.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re already a fan of some of these channels‚Äîone even has a popular English counterpart. Or, maybe I missed oned you would have included. Are there any other subjects you\u0026rsquo;d like me to list out some great German YouTube channels about? Do you just want to shame me for writing a listicle? Whatever the case, just drop a comment below if you want to say something. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just to ring the shame bell).\n","date":"March 13, 2021","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/german-science-youtube-channels/","tags":["learn german","recommendations","comprehensible input"],"title":"10 Great German Science Youtube Channels"},{"categories":["Language Learning","German"],"contents":"After almost a year of experimentation, I\u0026rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as \u0026ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll say that this is \u0026ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.\u0026rdquo; You can download it for free.\nEmphasis on probably.\nThis template automatically generates cloze-deletions from example sentences, determines the gender of nouns and color-codes accordingly, and recognizes and highlights irregular verbs. It supports images and audio for both German words and example sentences, and has an inutitive input format that uses the same fields for all parts of speech‚Äîno special fields for nouns, verbs, etc. that are left blank all the time.\nI released a similar template before, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work for verbs. This template works for all German words, and even has some extra features for verbs.\nThe Anki template with example cards is free Pay-what-you-want if you like, but otherwise just enjoy.\n  Get the free deck  If you notice any issues with the template or have comments, questions, ideas for improvements, or otherwise want to get in touch, please email me at hello@monoglotanxiety.com.\nAbout the template The point of this German Anki template is to make it easier to make well-formatted German flashcards that help you learn better. That means making cloze deletions fast and easy, using an intuitive field setup for quick input, and color-coding nouns and verbs to help you notice and remember the important grammatical properties of these words.\nFeatures  Nouns automatically color-coded by gender. The template determines a noun\u0026rsquo;s gender automatically from its definite article (der, die, or das) and color-codes accordingly. Irregular verb forms automatically highlighted. The template highlights irregular verbs by predicting a set of theoretial \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; conjugations and marking any that don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Cloze deletions automatically generated from example sentences. My template uses a little script to predict different forms a word might appear in, search for these forms in the example sentence, and generate a faux cloze deletion by removing the correct word and replacing it with [‚Ä¶]. This results in cards that look exactly like traditional clozes but doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any extra clicks or additional note types. Intuitive input with flexible fields that work for nouns, verbs, and everything else. The same set of fields work for every word, regardless of whether it is a verb, noun, or something else. Field order mirrors the typical order in which words and their variants (i.e. plurals, conjugations) are provided in vocabulary lists. Support for images and audio. Cards work without images and audio, but media is added easily. Separate audio for words and example sentences is supported.  Cards  Translation-to-German: Front - translation, image. Back - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, audio of german word + front   German-to-Translation: Front - German word, info (plural/conjugation), example sentence, image, audio of German word. Back - translation + front   Auto-close: Front - auto-cloze, translation, image. Back - auto-cloze answer, audio of example sentence, German word, info (plural/conjugation) + front  I hope this card format makes at least one aspect of your German study routine a bit easier. Flashcards are a super helpful tool, but time spent messing with formatting and making extra cloze deletion cards takes up time that could be better spent actually learning German.\n How-to guide There are example cards in the deck package that demonstrate how to use the template for nouns (plural-only and normal), verbs, and everything else. Follow the input format demonstrated in those cards and you\u0026rsquo;ll be golden. But just in case something isn\u0026rsquo;t clear, you can read the guidelines below. Shoot me an email at hello@monoglotanxiety.com if you\u0026rsquo;re confused or if you notice a bug.\nAt minimum, you need input for German and Translation. Auto-cloze rand color-coding require both Example and Info (for nouns and verbs) to work properly, and no auto-cloze card is attempted if no example sentence is provided.\nThe \u0026#39;Info\u0026#39; Field\nGerman nouns, verbs, and other words follow different sets of grammatical rules. This template works for all German words because it can determine what kind of word it\u0026rsquo;s dealing with and respond accordingly. The \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field contains grammatical information necessary for the auto-cloze and color-coding functions. For verbs, that means conjugations. For nouns, that means the plural form or a note indicating plural-only nouns. This might sound a bit complicated, but it\u0026rsquo;s intuitive once you see it in action‚Äîand a lot nicer to deal with than a bunch of noun- or verb-specific fields that get left empty all the time. Just be sure to look at the examples and take note of the simple rules below to avoid getting frustrated. Pay special attention to how to use the \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; field for verbs and nouns.\n   german: the German word. Nouns should be preceeded by their definite article (der, die, or das) and verbs should be in the infinitive. For reflexive verbs, add sich before the infinitive.  Examples: \u0026ldquo;der Hund\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;die Maus\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sprechen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sich wundern\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;abfahren\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;rot\u0026rdquo;   info: additional forms/information, usually only relevant for nouns and verbs.  Nouns: the plural preceeded by die. If the noun is plural-only write one of p, plural, plural only, or plural-only. For nouns with no plural, leave blank. Examples: die Hunde, die M√§use, plural, [no input] Verbs: provide the 3rd person present, preterite, and past perfect conjugations in that order, with \u0026ldquo;, \u0026quot; separating the elements. Provide the auxilliary verb. Examples: \u0026ldquo;spricht, sprach, hat gesprochen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wundert sich, wunderte sich, hat sich gewundert\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;f√§hrt ab, fuhr ab, ist abgefahren\u0026rdquo; Other: leave blank or use for custom information.   translation: the translation example: example sentence. Try to avoid using words that start with the same stem as the word you\u0026rsquo;re quizzing to avoid confusing the auto-cloze (e.x. don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde freuen sich‚Ä¶\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;freuen\u0026rdquo; since Freunde will look like a version of freuen to the auto-cloze script). register: extra field for notes on usage/register. Shown on all card fronts, so be careful with spoilers. Examples: \u0026ldquo;wissenschaftlich\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;√∂sterreichisch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gehoben\u0026rdquo; image: an image. If you use attribution text for the image, include it below the picture and it will be displayed in small text beneath the image. german audio: audio file for the german word. example audio: audio file for the example sentence.  Known issues Tell me if you find more or if you come up with a fix! Email hello@monoglotanxiety.com\n Auto-cloze mistakes words that begin with verb stems for a version of the verb, and deletes them. Example: Using \u0026ldquo;Meine Freunde meinen, dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind.\u0026rdquo; as an example for \u0026ldquo;meinen\u0026rdquo; will result in \u0026ldquo;[‚Ä¶] Freunde [‚Ä¶], dass Hunde gute Haustiere sind\u0026rdquo;.  Work-around: use a different example sentence.   Certain adjectives that change stem aren\u0026rsquo;t recognized by auto-cloze. Example: teuer ‚Äì\u0026gt; teuren is not recognized correctly because the e and r switch places.  Work-around: use example sentences that take the base form of these adjectives.

Probably."},{"categories":["Language Learning"],"contents":"Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!\nBut what to write?\nFiguring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible. But even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a writer, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet you write a lot in your native language‚Äîit\u0026rsquo;s just not writing of the \u0026ldquo;sit down and fill a page\u0026rdquo; variety. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly shooting off texts, commenting, writing posts, emailing, making to-do-lists, and filling up planners. Why not squeeze some language practice out of those activities?\nThis list of my favorite 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language hits on more traditional methods for improving long-form writing. But I also did my best to make suggestions for ways to weave writing practice into everyday life and get practice writing the short-form, informal texts that fill our inboxes, calendars, and notifications. My hope is that, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a writing enthusiast or the kind of person who only reluctantly picks up a pen, there will be at least one thing this list that will feel approachable to you.\nBut first, there\u0026rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind no matter how you choose to practice!\nThe golden rule of writing practice: get feedback from native speakers Making mistakes helps us learn, and getting corrected ensures that you won\u0026rsquo;t practice being wrong. So when practicing writing in a foreign language, try to focus on writing things that are either public by nature (ex. comments, forum posts) or that you\u0026rsquo;re willing to have corrected by a tutor or on a platform like LangCorrect. Make mistakes out in the open, where someone can notice them and correct you. Usually they\u0026rsquo;ll be nice about it. And if they aren\u0026rsquo;t, you can revel in the knowledge that they unknowingly provided you with free language corrections by trying to be a jerk. If you\u0026rsquo;re nervous, remember that tutors are paid to be nice to you.\nWays to get your writing corrected by native speakers:  Post, comment, blog, and otherwise slap your writing down all over the internet in communities full of native speakers. Odds are, if you make an egregious enough mistake, someone will point it out. Reddit is a great place for this kind of practice. Post your writing on a site like LangCorrect, Lang-8, or iTalki to get corrections for free from native speakers. LangCorrect corrections usually come back within a day or so in my experience. Work with a tutor. Watching a piece of your writing get corrected live is a great way to get a good sense for the kinds of errors you tend to make. iTalki is a good place to find online tutors. Ask a friend or language-exchange partner for help once you have a solid relationship in place.  The silver rule of writing practice: ignore the golden rule That all said, all writing practice is good writing practice. I keep a journal in German that no one‚Äîno one‚Äîwill ever see. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to see it. Grammar mistakes are one thing, but grammar mistakes in teenage angst at age 23 is another entirely. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do things *s u b o p t i m a l l y* if you want to, and incorperating language practice into things you might already do like keeping a journal or writing out grocery lists is pretty optimal if you ask me.\nOf course, more corrections means more progress. But more writing also means more progress. So whenever you can reasonably write something in your target language instead of your native language, do it‚Äîyou can think about having someone correct your grocery list or youtube comment later.\nOk, so with that out of the way, here\u0026rsquo;s my list of 11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language.\nHappy writing!\n11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language 1. Write an online journal on a language-exchange site There are a number of places online where you can write online journal entries and get them corrected by native speakers for free. Just be nice and correct a few entries in your native language in return. Lang-8, iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, and LangCorrect all offer exactly that. You could also check out the corrections board on the Polyglot Club.\nI personally favor LangCorrect because I feel like I get corrections back quickly and it\u0026rsquo;s obvious that the developers are working hard to steadily improve the site. Also, they seem more interested in making a good experience for people than making money, which is sweet. Unfortunately, Lang-8 isn\u0026rsquo;t taking new users at the time of writing. Also unfortunately, the iTalki community features are currently only fully available on mobile‚Ä¶ and I hate typing things on my phone. That seems set to change soon, though.\nAnd as a last note: you can use these sites for more than just journaling. Pretty much anything, even just single sentences, is fair game.\n2. Find a pen pal An oldie but a goodie, exchanging letters or emails with pen pals is a fun way to get to know people from around the world and learn a thing or two about culture in addition to practicing your target language. Writing letters is also a great way to get practice with long-form texts. You can find pen pals on forums for language learners like Polyglot Club and on specialized sites. FluentIn3Months has a nice list of 10 websites where you can look for pen pals. Oh, and check the subreddit for your target language, too. My experience with r/German has been nothing but positive.\n3. Exchange messages with a chat partner Don\u0026rsquo;t want to write out long letters, or would you rather practice writing the way you\u0026rsquo;d actually communicate with someone in every day life? Then consider finding a chat partner to message in your target language. Bilingua, Hellopal, Hellotalk, Speaky, and Tandem are all purpose-built chat apps for language exchange, but there are plenty of other sites where it\u0026rsquo;s possible to connect with chat partners. iTalki\u0026rsquo;s community section, the subreddit for your target language, and language-learning forums like Polyglot Club are a good place to look for partners as well. And then there\u0026rsquo;s Idyoma, an app which aims at connecting people in the same geographic area for language exchange with the possibility of meeting in real-life‚Äîbasically Tinder except for language exchange.\n4. Respond to writing prompts There are tons of websites out there with extensive lists of free writing prompts. Search for one in your target language, or just use any of the plentiful English resources out there.\nFor beginners, prompts for kids are fantastic. This prompt generator from My Cup Runs Over is amazing, with options to set your prompt level to elementary, middle, or high-school level. The prompt generator at Langauge is a Virus has plenty of beginner-friendly prompts, too. LangCorrect also has a large list of user-generated prompts, including plenty that are beginner friendly.\nFor intermediate and advanced learners, the New York Times maintains an amazing collection of writing prompts that\u0026rsquo;s available for free without a subscription. The Times also provides list of prompts for students organized by general theme. Resources for writers are also a great place to look for prompts if you have a good command of your target language and are into creative writing. Seventh Sanctum is a classic, and I like The Story Shack\u0026rsquo;s prompt generator a lot too since it provides very clear assignments.\n5. Do the writing exercises in textbooks, practice grammars, and practice exams ‚Äîyou know, those exercises that you skip because you don\u0026rsquo;t have a piece of blank paper on hand? Do them. And then have them corrected by a native speaker.\n6. Keep a bullet journal, planner, or calendar in your target language If you\u0026rsquo;re already writing daily in a planner or bullet journal, switching into your target language‚Äîeven if not for all of your entries‚Äîis a great way to squeeze some extra practice out of an activity you\u0026rsquo;d be doing anyways. Practicing this way has the added benefit of ensuring that you\u0026rsquo;ll learn vocabulary relevant to your life, since that\u0026rsquo;s what goes into a planner or journal.\nBullet journals are a fad worldwide at this point, so you should be able to find a blogger writing about them in your target language and appropriate vocabulary from their posts for things like \u0026ldquo;weekly spread\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to-do list.\u0026rdquo;\n7. Write your to-do lists, grocery lists, and other notes to yourself in your target language Like writing a journal or planner, writing to-do lists and other mundane notes to yourself is a great way to practice the words and phrases most relevant to your life. If you already write lists and notes to yourself, you can get practice without budgeting any extra time for language practice. And if you\u0026rsquo;re really motivated, there\u0026rsquo;s always the option to type up your lists and post them online for corrections from native speakers.\n8. Join subreddits where your target language is used Reddit can be a bit intimidating, but if you can get past the old-school layout and occasionally aggressive users‚Äîand they\u0026rsquo;re easy to avoid‚Äîit can be a great place to practice a new language. To start, check out the subreddits for your target language. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll find lots of other learners and friendly native speakers who are happy to make minor corrections to posts when they see mistakes. These boards are also a great place to find language exchange partners, and tend to be very friendly. I\u0026rsquo;ve had nothing but positive experiences with r/German and r/Danish.\nOnce you get a bit more comfortable, branch out and explore other subreddits where people post mainly in your target language. The country-specific subreddits for countries where your language is spoken are safe bets, and there are also more general subreddits specifically for content in various langages. For instance, r/de is for German (and sometimes English) content pertaining to all German-speaking countries. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there though‚Äîthere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to explore, and especially if you\u0026rsquo;re learning a rather \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; language with many speakers you\u0026rsquo;re sure to find all sorts of different subreddits where you can practice posting. Just be sure not to post questions about grammar/language-learning on country subreddits‚Äîthat\u0026rsquo;s what the language-specific subreddits are for. Check the subreddit rules before posting and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine!\n9. Leave comments on youtube videos, blogs, and other online content in your target language Like posting on Reddit, commenting on your favorite videos, blog posts, and other content in your target langauge is a great way to practice expressing an opininon in your target language and‚Äîthanks to the public nature of comments‚Äîto get some free corrections. People love pointing out how people are wrong in comments sections, and that extends to grammar. For best results, maybe don\u0026rsquo;t start out by leaping into a heated debate. Some communities are more positive and likely to provide *kind* corrections than others.\nI once got more than 600 likes on a comment I left on a video from a German Late-Night Comedy show, so I\u0026rsquo;m basically famous.\n10. Write example sentences for your flashcards (and use them to make cloze deletions) Being a flashcard junkie, I of course had to throw a flashcard tip into the ring here. One, admittedly nerdy way to get some writing practice is to create example sentences for your flashcards. Example sentences are great on their own, but they\u0026rsquo;re even better when used to create cloze deletions, or cards where the word(s) you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn are removed from a sentence and replaced with a blank. Clozes are a great way to learn words in context. Just be sure to get the sentences corrected by a native speaker so that you don\u0026rsquo;t practice something incorrect.\nThe free spaced-repetition flashcard program I use, Anki, has an easy-to-use cloze deletion format you can use if you just want to create flash cards based no example sentences. Unfortunately, it isn\u0026rsquo;t so straightforward to add cloze deletions to your existing cards if they\u0026rsquo;re not already cloze-format. But if you\u0026rsquo;re learning German, I made a German Anki flashcard format that can figure out where the relevant words are in your example sentences to automatically generates cloze deletions. It color-codes nouns by gender, too. Currently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for nouns, but I have a version with support for verbs coming out soon!\n  Get the free¬†template\n 11. Contribute to wikipedia pages in your target language I saved the nerdiest suggestion for last. You\u0026rsquo;re almost certainly familiar with Wikipedia already‚Äîbut have you ever checked out Wikipedia in your target language? Chances are, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of content just waiting to be translated from your native language into your target language. You can get writing practice while simultaneously contributing to making knowledge accessible for free to people around the world.\nTo start with, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to translate content directly out of your native language into your target language. To find pages to edit or create, keep an eye on the sidebar on the left: languages in which a page on the current topic exists are listed. If your target language isn\u0026rsquo;t listed, that means that nobody has made a page in that language yet. And even if there is a page, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees that it will contain all the same information as the page in your native language. Browse through, look for places where you could add in a fact by translating, and then make your edits. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry about making a mistake here or there: if you do make a mistake, someone else can easily fix it later.\nYou can also do this in reverse, translating from your target language into your native language. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of fun translating pages and facts from German Wikipedia into English‚Äîlike this one on an Austrian satirical political party that advocates for replacing a famous fountian in Vienna with a beer fountain, among other things.\n I hope you enjoyed this list of ways to practice writing in a foreign language.

So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I\u0026rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.\nThis is my honest Pimsleur Danish review after following the course for 30 days. And since I\u0026rsquo;m a nerd, I also worked through German 5 simultaneously to get a sense of how far Pimsleur could take my Danish if I stuck with it. So while this review is about Pimlsuer Danish, it draws on what I learned about Pimsleur generally by skipping ahead in langauge I speak at a higher level than Pimsleur teaches.\nPimsleur Danish Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬† Price: $119.99 for 30 days/15 hrs of audio lessons s $14.99/month with the subscription model Positives\n Starts with speaking from day 1 Listen-and-repeat is great for pronunciation and an especially good fit for Danish Spaced repetition method backed by research Strict 30 min/day goal is motivating Audio format is very convenient - lessons can be done hands-free anywhere you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable speaking and have your smartphone (I did mine in the shower, but it\u0026rsquo;d be perfect for a commute)  Negatives\n Teaches tiny amount of vocabulary for 15 hours of study Conversation scenarios are often outdated and sexist and leave out important basics Feels more like memorizing set phrases than learning to speak most of the time Reading lessons are just lists of words to pronounce, not language in context High price (use the subscription version or get Pimsleur from your library) Not directly relevant, but Pimsleur clearly self-promotes on Reddit which enrages me :angry:  Summary\nOverall, I can\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed. In a lot of ways, the course seems stuck back in 1963 when it was invented and it definitely falls short of its promise of \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo; conversation in 30 days. There is a real problem with dated social contexts and weirdly blatant sexism. And all those lessons on how to use your sub-A1 Danish to hit on married women in Copenhagen aren\u0026rsquo;t just annoying‚Äîthey waste valuable space in Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s already slim curriculum. In 30 days, it barely teaches what you\u0026rsquo;d learn in one or two weeks of a textbook course. That said, going through the course did motivate me to start studying Danish again, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all bad. There is a reason Pimsleur is popular. Spaced repetition works, and by the end of 30 days you\u0026rsquo;ll understand basic conversations and have a decent feel for pronunciation. The listen-and-repeat format is convenient and an especially good fit for Danish because of its tricky pronunciation‚Äîand this \u0026ldquo;especially good fit\u0026rdquo; is ultimately why I chose to give Pimsleur Danish 3 stars rather than 2.\nAnd for the record, I reccomended Pimsleur to my mom, who is trying to learn Portuguese. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good system for folks who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to study a language on their own and just need to get a sense for how their target language sounds.\nThe basics: how it works and what you\u0026rsquo;ll learn As with other Pimsleur courses, each lesson of Pimsleur Danish consists of a ~30 min audio recording in which you are queued to respond in Danish both to random prompts (i.e. how do you say 56 in Danish?) and in conversational scenarios. Most prompts are given in English. Words are introduced and revisited later, often in slightly new contexts‚Äîthis is is the spaced repetition method that made Pimsleur famous. When words are introduced, you are asked to repeat after one of the two Danish native speakers (one female, one male) and then you hear the native pronuciation again afterwards. Long words are broken down and introduced from end to beginning, which I found very helpful.\nMost of the lesson involves responding to prompts. You usually aren\u0026rsquo;t given a lot of time to think before one of the speakers says the answer and you\u0026rsquo;re given a chance to repeat it. That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing in my book‚Äîit reminds me a lot of how language teachers correct speech by repeating back an incorrect sentence or pronunciation correctly, modeling the correct version of whatever the student was originally trying to say.\nThe Danish course also comes with a reading booklet containing numbered lists of words and corresponding audio files that walk through how to pronounce them. The point of the reading exercises isn\u0026rsquo;t to learn how to read and understand content‚Äîmany of the words aren\u0026rsquo;t introduced in the Pimsleur course at all, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t provided with a translation or context‚Äîbut rather how to pronounce written Danish. Pronouncing written Danish is hard, so that\u0026rsquo;s important. But reading a list of random words you don\u0026rsquo;t understand isn\u0026rsquo;t a very motivating experience and doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with reading comprehension. I often didn\u0026rsquo;t complete the reading lessons.\nThe conversation scenarios tended to be oriented around the following topics:\n Greetings and saying goodbye Saying that you\u0026rsquo;re American and come from New York \u0026ldquo;I speak a little Danish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Do you speak English?\u0026rdquo; Asking what a word means and asking someone to repeat themselves Words for wife, husband, children, and friends Ordering food/drink at a cafe (a sandwich, coffee, tea, beer, wine, or water) Names of major Danish cities (and a few obscure ones) Telling time Numbers 1-100 Basic travel plans (car-focused, odd for DK)  For a 30 day course, the amount of vocabulary covered is very, very small. The first few chapters of any textbook will get you further. And this parcity of vocabulary only makes it all the more confusing that Pimsleur decided to devote a significant chunk of the lessons to topics like‚Ä¶\n Your big German car Gasoline prices How expensive wine is in Denmark \u0026ldquo;Where is Vesterbrogade?\u0026rdquo; Asking women if they\u0026rsquo;re travelling together with their husband Buying Legos for your kids Inviting someone back to your place Inviting someone back to your place after she\u0026rsquo;s said no 5 times  The perfect preparation for time travel to Copenhagen in 1963 The original Pimsleur courses were developed by linguist Dr. Paul Pimsleur back in 1963 and adapted for popular consuption in the 1970s. And if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the occasional reference to cellphones, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seem like they\u0026rsquo;ve been updated at all since. The social scenarios and dialogue often feel ripped straight out of the past.\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to forgive a certain degree of conservatism in a language course that\u0026rsquo;s intended to be friendly to government and corperate customers. But the assumption that you\u0026rsquo;re a married upper-class businessman is very much baked into the course content, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not a married upper-class businessman, you\u0026rsquo;ll be left unable to describe yourself or get by in even very basic situations. And what\u0026rsquo;s worse, instead of learning useful things (like, say, the word for \u0026ldquo;food\u0026rdquo;), you waste time rehearsing sexist scripts.\nFor instance, in one lesson I had to ask a woman to come back to my place about 10 times, suggesting a different time of day each time she said no. There are more useful and less disgusting ways to teach time‚Äîdiscussing train schedules, for instance, which would have been a much more \u0026ldquo;travel\u0026rdquo; topic for Denmark than cars and gasoline prices, which is what Pimsleur chose to focus on despite Denmark not being a car country at all.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of Danish 1 but in German 5, there was a lesson that taught vocabulary related to flat tires and roadside assistance. And in in every. single. scenario, the female speaker needed roadside assistance or her husband to change the tire while the male speaker did it himself (often to save his poor wife the trouble of calling for help). Think: \u0026ldquo;I changed the tire, but if my wife had been travelling alone, she would have definitely called for roadside assistance\u0026rdquo; repeated in all its variations for 30 minutes.\nThis focus on cars strikes me as another businessman-bias, since a businessman is just about the only person I could imagine ever renting a car in Denmark (I\u0026rsquo;ll forgive the assumption in car-happy Germany). Pimsleur is really into cars. It taught me how to say \u0026ldquo;I have a big German car\u0026rdquo; before I learned to say where I live, and never touched on planes, trains, bicycles, or busses.\nAnd as one final example of both the sexist tilt and business-class bias, one of the very first things you learn is to ask people back to your place for dinner. I mean, maybe that makes sense if you\u0026rsquo;re a business-class businessman doing a business dinner in your Copenhagen business apartment. But for everyone else‚Ä¶ it\u0026rsquo;s just weird. And worse, for a language course with a $120 price tag, it\u0026rsquo;s useless.\nCall me a buzzkill, but I think you should at least learn how to ask someone\u0026rsquo;s name before you start hitting on them in a language you can\u0026rsquo;t speak.\nAn \u0026ldquo;intermediate level\u0026rdquo; in 30 days of Pimsleur? Ok, so‚Ä¶ no.\nJust no.\nI took the Danish Modul 1 test while living in Odense, so I have an idea of what you need to know in order to pass the absolute most basic test for Danish learners. The Modul 1 test isn\u0026rsquo;t even an A1-level test‚Äîit is sub-A1, a benchmark along the way towards preparing to take the real thing. For those of you not familiar with the CEFR language scale, A1 is the most basic level on a 6-level scale running from A1 to C2. The minimum level that could be considered intermediate would be B1.\nAfter 30 days of Pimsleur Danish alone, you would not be prepared for the Modul 1 test, let alone an A1 exam. So forget about \u0026ldquo;intermediate.\u0026quot;\nThis is something that really frustrates me about Pimsleur‚Äîand plenty of other language-learning products. I wish they\u0026rsquo;d just be honest with us about what they offered. Because even if Pimsleur was being honest, it would still have a good marketing pitch:\n \u0026ldquo;The perfect companion to classrom or individual study for on-the-go A1-level learners. Speak more spontaneously and improve your accent in just 30 days!\u0026rdquo;\n That\u0026rsquo;d be both honest and more helpful. For an A1 learner, Pimsleur offers a great way to get practice responding quickly in simple conversations and‚Äîwhat I see as its biggest advantage over other programs‚Äîto work on pronunciation.\nI wrote something similar in my post on Duolingo a while back, and it really does drive me nuts how often various resources oversell themselves as language-learning panceas. There isn\u0026rsquo;t any one resource out there that will teach you everything. There just isn\u0026rsquo;t. Every tool has its use (and some are more useful than others). Learners could get a lot more out of programs‚Äîand could be easily convinced to purchase additional resources‚Äîif it was clear exactly what each one was offering.\nBut while everyone oversells, Pimsleur oversells with chutzpah. \u0026ldquo;Converse at an intermediate level in 30 days\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t a promise it can keep‚Äîand I sincerely doubt any resource short of matrix-style brain downloads could. This stuff takes time.\nDespite its flaws, there are reasons to use Pimsleur After all this criticism, you might be wondering why I gave Pimsleur Danish 3 stars. And if I were writing this review just for myself and learners like me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rated it so high.\nBut despite that, I still reccomended Pimsleur to my mom. Why?\nFirst, ease of use: a course you can listen to while driving, cleaning, cooking, showering, gardening, petting a cat, or really anything else that doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with your ability to hear and speak requires almost no activation energy to use. And the fact that Pimsleur limits you to 30 minutes per day of study is hugely motivating for people who tend not to start learning new things because they find them intimidating (so most of us). It\u0026rsquo;s clear what you should to to learn each day and that makes it easier to stick with Pimsleur than, say, Duolingo, which allows you to set your own goals or none at all.\nSecond, Pimsleur teaches listening and pronunciation. If you\u0026rsquo;re not going to cough up the cash for lessons with a native speaker or find a language exchange partner somewhere, Pimsleur can help fill in some of the gaps when it comes to those very important skills. Of course, actually speaking is always, always going to be better than rehearsing conversations. But letting perfection get in the way of good enough is a terrible strategy no matter what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so I\u0026rsquo;m glad Pimsleur and courses like it are out there for folks who can\u0026rsquo;t afford or arrange one-on-one time with native speakers. My mom could have found a tutor on iTalki, but realistically I know she\u0026rsquo;d be too embarassed to start from 0 in real conversations. And since I didn\u0026rsquo;t start speaking German for about a year after I started studying it, I understand the impulse. I\u0026rsquo;m not making that mistake with Danish and I really do reccomend speaking with a real person over an audio course if you can.\nThird, spaced repetition works, and even if you won\u0026rsquo;t learn very much vocabulary with Pimsleur you\u0026rsquo;re likely to remember the vocabulary you do learn. It\u0026rsquo;s a good foundation for building upon, and getting those first few words and \u0026ldquo;conversations\u0026rdquo; out of the way builds confidence. Spaced repetition also contributes to making Pimsleur a positive, motivating experience‚Äîit feels great to feel like you have answers to simpel questions on the tip of your tongue, and that\u0026rsquo;s what spaced repetition gives you in Pimsleur (although the responses are more rehearsed than spontaneous‚Ä¶ which is why I see this as more of a motivation helper than a good language-learning strategy)\nSo yes, there are reasons the Pimsleur courses have stood the test of time and remain so popular despite their flaws.\nPimsleur costs too much, but there are (100% legal) ways to get around that problem If you think Pimsleur is the course for you, please, please don\u0026rsquo;t do what I did and pay $120 for 15 hours of audio lessons. I could have booked 8 lessons with my Danish iTalki tutor for that much. For what Pimsleur is, the price is too high. A lot of the price is definitely the brand.\nLuckily, there are some (legal, put away your pirate flags) options out there for getting around the price tag.\nFirst, Pimsleur offers a subscription version of its courses for $14.99/month. You get access to all of the material for a given language for as long as you\u0026rsquo;re subscribed‚Äîyou just don\u0026rsquo;t get to keep the course afterwards. Since Danish has only one 30-day course, you\u0026rsquo;d only need to pay $15 to do the whole course over one month with the subscription model. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a totally fair price for what Pimsleur is. Almost 10x the price just to keep the recordings (which you should not listen to more than once anyways) isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it any way you slice it.\nAnother alternative is to check your library‚Äîthanks to Pimsleur\u0026rsquo;s fame and long-time popularity, it\u0026rsquo;s a common item in library catalogues in the US. My library didn\u0026rsquo;t have all 5 German courses, but it had the first 3 and Danish as well.\nWhat do you think? Was this Pimsleur Danish review helpful?

You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you\u0026rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that\u0026rsquo;s no small thing.\nA lot of ink has already been spilled on the pros and cons of Duolingo by more accomplished language bloggers (and more self-confident redditors) than me. So I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details too much here. The biggest gripe I have with the green owl is that he mostly asks for translations out of the target language rather than into it. The sentences also aren\u0026rsquo;t very natural and some are downright weird. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the most effective way to learn, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot more mileage out of other methods like making your own flashcard decks, practicing with speaking partners, or even just watching TV in your target language.\nSo Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s advantage isn\u0026rsquo;t that it works. It has something else going for it.\nDuolingo can replace other addictive apps If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you probably pull out your phone almost compulsively whenever there\u0026rsquo;s an idle moment: standing in line, riding the bus, waiting for meetings to start, going to the bathroom‚Ä¶ This isn\u0026rsquo;t the place to go into whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a habit worth cracking, but it is relevant to discussing the pros and cons of Duolingo because the best use for Duolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t as a study tool but as an upgrade to our phone addictions.\nMaybe Duolingo should do a better job of pointing that out instead of marketing itself as the \u0026ldquo;best way to learn a language.\u0026rdquo; But the \u0026ldquo;usefully addictive way to start learning a language\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same ring to it.\nDuolingo is a language-learning game. It takes advantage of a lot of the same psychology that keeps us compulsively pulling out our pocket-screens over and over and over again. With all its bright colors and achievements and rewards, Duolingo is frighteningly easy to get addicted to, just like many of the apps we already use. Except that instead of encouraging you to browse social media or crush candy or word with friends or whatever, Duolingo will give you language exposure.\nImperfect language exposure, yes, but language exposure. Especially for beginners (A1-A2 level), I think that Duolingo works great as a sort of nearly-passive rolling review of vocabulary and grammar. Seeing words and concepts that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned elsewhere again in a new (admittedly sometimes super awkward and weird) context never hurts.\nDuolingo isn\u0026rsquo;t bad if you use it effectively The best way to use Duolingo is to substitute it 1:1 for other things you\u0026rsquo;d already be doing with your phone that don\u0026rsquo;t help you learn. Just take care not to let Duolingo start creeping in on the time you\u0026rsquo;d usually spend on more effective study methods.\nUse it when you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line at checkout, use it when you catch yourself scrolling endlessly through facebook videos, use it stealthily under the table during boring meetings, on the subway, on the toilet‚Äìyou get the picture. It won\u0026rsquo;t get you far on its own. But so long as it\u0026rsquo;s always a an appetizer and never the main course, it can only help you. You won\u0026rsquo;t get worse at your target language by using it, and you might even get a teensy bit better.\nBascially, treat Duolingo like any other phone game you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong.\nAs an example of how this can work, I used Duolingo to start learning German at a time when I had just just enough motivation to drag myself through my university coursework and watch TV from underneath the pile of unwashed landry I forgot to clear off my bed. Just swapping in Duolingo for my old phone habit checking the New York Times headlines (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription, just read the headlines over and over) and switching the TV to German got me to a point where I could start compulsively checking S√ºddeutsche Zeitung headlines in about three months. Three months of really not putting any effort in.\nI did watch a lot of TV, though.\nThis all comes with a caveat, though. Like I said, Duolingo works best for beginners and once I hit an intermediate (B1-B2) level, I found myself using Duolingo less because I could finally relax and passively consume content made for German native speakers. Forgive me, but while there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of material out there made specifically for new learners, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in hearing another story about b e i n g a n e x c h a n g e s t u d e n t i n M u n i c h or pestering Viennese train station employees for unrealistically detailed directions to a hotel. I found it tough to get drawn into beginner resources. But once I was able to start reading, listening and watching real content in German, I got addicted to plenty of great podcasts and Youtube channels and gradually retired my Duolingo habit.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that others would say that you\u0026rsquo;d be better served by subbing out whatever you tend to do on your phone with X,Y, or Z. And X, Y, and Z probably will help you learn faster than Duolingo‚Äîif you can manage to get as addicted to them as you are to whatever you do with your phone already.\nIf not? There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong hitting up Duo for some good fun translating classic phrases like \u0026ldquo;they wash the holy potato.\u0026rdquo;\n Owl trophy image from https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/8613388/I-Have-Conquered-My-German-Treewith,¬†edited by me\n","date":"December 8, 2020","image":"{{ . }}","permalink":"/blog/is-duolingo-bad/","tags":["language resources","language learning tips","language apps"],"title":"Is Duolingo bad?"}]
