      <description>Welcome back to my language diary. Which is apparently biweekly now with posts appearing on either Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on how I feel.
Yes I know bloggers are supposed to be reliable, but my whole &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; is kinda chaos so forgive me this completely in-character 2 day buffer period.</description>

      <description>I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she&amp;rsquo;s doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.</description>
