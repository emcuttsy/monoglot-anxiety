      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>

      <title>Vocabulary booster pack: German words for &#39;drunk&#39;</title>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of words that mean &amp;ldquo;drunk&amp;rdquo; in German. This post walks through more than 20 of them, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards with every variation of &amp;ldquo;tipsy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;smashed&amp;rdquo; you could ever want that&amp;rsquo;s available for pay-what-you-want (so probably free).
Given that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beer—so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor&amp;rsquo;s Travel forum: can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?</description>
