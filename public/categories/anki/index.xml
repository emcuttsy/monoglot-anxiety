      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of words that mean &amp;ldquo;drunk&amp;rdquo; in German. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>
