      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <description>In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.
A common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the &lt;strong&gt;German dative plural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
