      <title>Booster Pack: German cooking verbs</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bad cook, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to follow recipes even when they&amp;rsquo;re written in plain English—let alone sputtered out rapid-fire in German as I try to handle knives and hot pans without maiming myself. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been cooking more with my boyfriend, and when he bothers to use a recipe all it always ends up as rapid-fire German sputtering even if it started out a written recipe. Clearly it was time to get to work on a flashcard deck of German cooking verbs.</description>

      <title>10 great German science YouTube channels</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/german-science-youtube-channels/</link>

      <description>German science videos were some of the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; German media that I could understand. It might sound like a tough place to start, but thanks to the overlap between English and German scienctific vocabulary, science videos can actually be a great entry into authentic German content (especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a nerd like me). These 10 channels are a great resource for German learners or anyone else looking for awesome science videos in German.</description>

      <title>Booster Pack: German tree vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-tree-vocabulary/</link>

      <description>When we learn a new language, we focus on learning the words we actually need to communicate. But eventually, you might want to be able to get across points like &amp;ldquo;pine tree&amp;rdquo; without having to say things like &amp;ldquo;der Baum, der Nadeln statt Blätter hat.&amp;rdquo;
This week&amp;rsquo;s booster pack is a deck full of eventually words involving trees—both the German names for specific types of trees and the German words for parts of trees like roots and branches.</description>

      <title>The best German Anki template. Probably. Automatic color-coding and cloze deletions</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/</guid>
      <description>After almost a year of experimentation, I&amp;rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as &amp;ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll say that this is &amp;ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.&amp;rdquo; You can download it for free.
Emphasis on probably.
This template automatically generates cloze-deletions from example sentences, determines the gender of nouns and color-codes accordingly, and recognizes and highlights irregular verbs.</description>

      <description>Scrolling through Reddit today, I came across a great new website for German learners made by an r/German user. The site is called Interpolly, and it allows you to easily create German vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos. I checked it out and really liked the site, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up a little review as a way of saying thanks to the developer for making this free tool for German learners.</description>

      <title>Booster pack: German hiking vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-hiking-vocabulary/</link>

      <description>Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re at the &amp;ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies&amp;rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this free Anki deck of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won&amp;rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-classe-jahrgang-studienrichtung/</link>

      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <title>Booster Pack: German words for drunk</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/</link>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of free Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <title>Anki template for German that automatically generates cloze deletions and color-codes nouns</title>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</guid>
      <description>In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.
A common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the &lt;strong&gt;German dative plural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
