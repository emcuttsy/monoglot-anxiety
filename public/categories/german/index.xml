      <description>Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re at the &amp;ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies&amp;rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this booster pack of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won&amp;rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!</description>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>

      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>

      <description>Clawing my brain apart trying to remember whether a verb takes the dative or accusative case is one of those universal German-learning struggles that I imagine inspired the whole &amp;ldquo;Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache&amp;rdquo; idea. And I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that many of the words that most often initiate a holy-$h!#-what-case-do-I-use death-spiral are the common verbs describing speech: sagen, fragen, and co.
The funny thing is, these verbs actually mostly–and I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;rsquo;get to the mostly bit–behave according to the usual rules dictating case in German.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad? Maybe, but it&#39;s still worth downloading</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duolingo gets a lot of flack in some corners of the language-learning internet, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: the German Dative Plural</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/fehler-files-1-german-dative-plural/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a language coward. I started learning German on my own, and for the longest time I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak at all despite developing rather good comprehension. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I was just too scared of embarrassing myself. Eventually, I hired a tutor to get some speech practice, and only after that did I finally work up the courage to start practicing with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
