      <description>As one reader put it, teaching myself German took &amp;ldquo;2 years of not really doing much actually&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Lots of German! Also: I finally found a way to track my language learning time consistently.</description>

      <description>As an English native speaker, explicitly calling out that I&amp;rsquo;m female all the time feels more backwards than progressive. Many German speakers feel exactly the opposite</description>

      <description>Welcome back to my language diary. Which is apparently biweekly now with posts appearing on either Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on how I feel.
Yes I know bloggers are supposed to be reliable, but my whole &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; is kinda chaos so forgive me this completely in-character 2 day buffer period.</description>

      <description>I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she&amp;rsquo;s doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.</description>

      <description>Last week on Monday I officially went from monoglot to&amp;hellip; duo-glot? Bilingual sounds wrong. I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up speaking two languages.
Anyways, as a newly minted official Goethe Institute certified B2 German speaker, I wanted to stop and share how I prepped for the test—and really, how I didn&amp;rsquo;t prep for the test.</description>

      <title>10 Great German Science Youtube Channels</title>
      <link>https://monoglotanxiety.com/blog/german-science-youtube-channels/</link>

      <description>German science videos were some of the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; German media that I could understand. It might sound like a tough place to start, but thanks to the overlap between English and German scienctific vocabulary, science videos can actually be a great entry into authentic German content (especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a nerd like me).</description>

      <title>The best German Anki template ever. Probably.</title>
      <link>https://monoglotanxiety.com/blog/german-anki-template/</link>

      <description>After almost a year of experimentation, I&amp;rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as &amp;ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll say that this is &amp;ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.</description>
