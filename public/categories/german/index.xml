      <description>Scrolling through Reddit today, I came across a great new website for German learners made by an r/German user. The site is called Interpolly, and it allows you to easily create German vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos. I checked it out and really liked the site, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up a little review as a way of saying thanks to the developer for making this free tool for German learners.</description>

      <title>Booster pack: German hiking vocabulary</title>

      <description>Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re at the &amp;ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies&amp;rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this free Anki deck of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won&amp;rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!</description>

      <title>Anki template for German that automatically generates cloze deletions and color-codes nouns</title>

      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>

      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of free Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</guid>
      <description>In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.
A common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the &lt;strong&gt;German dative plural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
