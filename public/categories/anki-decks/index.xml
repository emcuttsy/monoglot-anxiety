      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of words that mean &amp;ldquo;drunk&amp;rdquo; in German. This post walks through more than 20 of them, and I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a link to a set of Anki cards with all the variations of &amp;ldquo;tipsy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;smashed&amp;rdquo; you could ever need at the end.

I worked part-time in a board game shop a few summers ago, and like many board game shops, this place made most of its income selling and re-selling Magic the Gathering cards.</description>
