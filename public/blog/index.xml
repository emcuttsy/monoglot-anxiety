      <title>Booster Pack: German cooking verbs</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bad cook, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to follow recipes even when they&amp;rsquo;re written in plain English—let alone sputtered out rapid-fire in German as I try to handle knives and hot pans without maiming myself. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been cooking more with my boyfriend, and when he bothers to use a recipe all it always ends up as rapid-fire German sputtering even if it started out a written recipe. Clearly it was time to get to work on a flashcard deck of German cooking verbs.</description>

      <title>10 great German science YouTube channels</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/german-science-youtube-channels/</link>

      <description>German science videos were some of the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; German media that I could understand. It might sound like a tough place to start, but thanks to the overlap between English and German scienctific vocabulary, science videos can actually be a great entry into authentic German content (especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a nerd like me). These 10 channels are a great resource for German learners or anyone else looking for awesome science videos in German.</description>

      <title>Booster Pack: German tree vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-tree-vocabulary/</link>

      <description>When we learn a new language, we focus on learning the words we actually need to communicate. But eventually, you might want to be able to get across points like &amp;ldquo;pine tree&amp;rdquo; without having to say things like &amp;ldquo;der Baum, der Nadeln statt Blätter hat.&amp;rdquo;
This week&amp;rsquo;s booster pack is a deck full of eventually words involving trees—both the German names for specific types of trees and the German words for parts of trees like roots and branches.</description>

      <title>The best German Anki template. Probably. Automatic color-coding and cloze deletions</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/the-best-german-anki-template/</guid>
      <description>After almost a year of experimentation, I&amp;rsquo;m finally satisfied enough with my German Anki template to dare to think it might be useful for others. So in the spirit of Mads Mikkelsen advertising a pretty mediocre Danish beer as &amp;ldquo;probably the best beer in the world,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll say that this is &amp;ldquo;probably the best German Anki template on the internet.&amp;rdquo; You can download it for free.
Emphasis on probably.
This template automatically generates cloze-deletions from example sentences, determines the gender of nouns and color-codes accordingly, and recognizes and highlights irregular verbs.</description>

      <description>Scrolling through Reddit today, I came across a great new website for German learners made by an r/German user. The site is called Interpolly, and it allows you to easily create German vocabulary quizzes from YouTube videos. I checked it out and really liked the site, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up a little review as a way of saying thanks to the developer for making this free tool for German learners.</description>

      <title>Booster pack: German hiking vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-hiking-vocabulary/</link>

      <description>Hiking has been an escape for me throughout the pandemic, and I like to imagine where I might go hiking once this is over. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re at the &amp;ldquo;sanguine tourism fantasies&amp;rdquo; stage of covid-19… Anyways, all that daydreaming inspired this free Anki deck of German hiking vocabulary. Even though travel restrictions mean most of us won&amp;rsquo;t be flying off to hike in the Alps anytime soon, we can at least upgrade our pandemic daydreams with a dose of linguistic authenticity!</description>

      <title>11 ways to practice writing in a foreign language</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/11-ways-to-practice-writing-in-a-foreign-language/</link>

      <description>Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!
But what to write?
Figuring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible.</description>

      <title>A candid review of Pimsleur Danish</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/pimsleur-danish-review/</link>

      <description>I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer. I had been focusing on German exclusively until then, but given what I&amp;rsquo;d paid for Pimsleur (too much, see below), my stinginess demanded that I give Danish another shot.</description>

      <title>Are your classmates in your Klasse, Jahrgang, or Studienrichtung?</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-classe-jahrgang-studienrichtung/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-classe-jahrgang-studienrichtung/</guid>
      <description>How do you say &amp;ldquo;class of 2020&amp;rdquo; in German? TLDR: you might get away with Jahrgang 2016, but that translation might not carry all the meaning you expect it to—especially if you&amp;rsquo;re from the US.
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the situation in other English-speaking countries, but at least in the US it is very common for students to think of themselves as belonging to a &amp;ldquo;class,&amp;rdquo; or cohort of students who began their studies in the same year.</description>

      <title>Booster Pack: German words for drunk</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/booster-pack-german-words-for-drunk/</link>

      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of German words for drunk. This post walks through 18 of them as well as words for discussing the aftermath of a night out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of free Anki cards so you might have a shot at remembering them when the time comes.</description>

      <title>Anki template for German that automatically generates cloze deletions and color-codes nouns</title>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/anki-format-for-german-that-automatically-generates-cloze-deletions-and-color-codes-nouns/</guid>
      <description>One of my major frustrations with Anki is the stiffness of cloze-formatted cards. They just don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with basic card types. So while I often want to incorperate cloze deletions into my decks, making seperate notes for clozes of my example sentences is simply beyond my effort tolerance. So instead of spending an extra 30sec/card, I did the clearly easier thing and spent a week figuring out how to get basic cards to automatically make cloze deletions based on example sentences.</description>

      <title>Fehler Files: Talking about talking in German</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 18:31:32 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/common-german-mistakes-describing-speech/</guid>
      <description>In Fehler Files, I break down common German mistakes that I make in real conversations so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make similar mistakes yourself. Think of it like a series of self-deprecating mini-guides to German grammar and vocabulary. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s about using German verbs describing speech, such as erzählen and fragen.
A common mistake with verbs that describe speech is to use the wrong case for the person being addressed, so I break down which verbs are dative verbs and which are accusative, and how to remember the difference.</description>

      <title>Conditional formatting based on field content for Anki flashcards</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/conditional-formatting-based-on-field-content-for-anki-flashcards/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/conditional-formatting-based-on-field-content-for-anki-flashcards/</guid>
      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code for conditional formatting in Anki based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad?</title>
      <link>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-duolingo-bad/</link>

      <guid>https://www.monoglotanxiety.com/blog/is-duolingo-bad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Duolingo bad? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going through a way I keep butchering the &lt;strong&gt;German dative plural.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
