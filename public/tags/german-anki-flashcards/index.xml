      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of words that mean &amp;ldquo;drunk&amp;rdquo; in German. This post walks through more than 20 of them, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards with every variation of &amp;ldquo;tipsy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;smashed&amp;rdquo; you could ever want that&amp;rsquo;s available for pay-what-you-want (so probably free).
Given that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beer—so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor&amp;rsquo;s Travel forum: can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?</description>

      <description>Anki allows conditoinal formatting based on whether or not fields are empty, but you’ll need to use a bit of code to change your cards based on field content. Luckily, it’s not that hard, and using this trick you can conditionally display text as well. I use it to color-code my German flashcards by noun gender without having to do everything by hand.
Out-of-the-box, Anki supports &amp;ldquo;conditional replacement,&amp;rdquo; which changes what gets rendered on a card is based on whether or not fields are empty.</description>
