      <description>There are lots of language learning strategies and programs out there for beginners, and I think that most of them probably workâ€”if only because they involve spending lots of time with your new language. But I&amp;rsquo;m lazy. And maybe you are, too. So if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to learn a new language with no real plan and close to 0 focused study, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place. Welcome to my silly experiment.</description>

      <description>Writing is one of my favorite ways to actively study German. It is great for vocabulary building and grammar practice, and in the absence of speaking opportunities, it is the only way to get practice with production skills. But beyond simply being a great way to practice on its own, writing is a key component of how I use flashcards and spaced repetition to learn German. In this post, I break down how to use writing practice to get more out of spaced repetition systems like Anki.</description>

      <description>Learning to write in a new laguage can be intimidating, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re learning alone. Like speaking, writing is a productive skill which makes it impossible to learn passively. Reading will improve your writing, to be sure. But if you want to write, you need to write!
But what to write?
Figuring that out is the tough bit. And given that writers block can easily strike even when writing in our native languages, sitting down in front of a blank page to scribble something down in a new language can feel downright impossible.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Duolingo bad? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
