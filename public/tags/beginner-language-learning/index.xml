      <description>I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she&amp;rsquo;s doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate levelÂ (about B1 for you CEFR people).
I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;d be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner.</description>
