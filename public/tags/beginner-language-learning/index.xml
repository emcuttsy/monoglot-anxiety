      <description>Welcome back to my language diary. Which is apparently biweekly now with posts appearing on either Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on how I feel.
Yes I know bloggers are supposed to be reliable, but my whole &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; is kinda chaos so forgive me this completely in-character 2 day buffer period.</description>

      <description>I sincerely hope that future Elise will have a much better idea what she&amp;rsquo;s doing with this whole language business than today Elise, and with that in mind I thought it could be fun to start keeping track of exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to (approximately) each week. Future Elise can look back and laugh smugly at my mistakes.</description>

      <title>Is it worth hiring a language tutor as a beginner?</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate levelÂ (about B1 for you CEFR people).
I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;d be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner.</description>
