      <description>Depending on your stereotypes of German speakers, you may or may not be surprised to learn that there are a lot of words that mean &amp;ldquo;drunk&amp;rdquo; in German. This post walks through more than 20 of them, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also put them together as a neat set of Anki cards with every variation of &amp;ldquo;tipsy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;smashed&amp;rdquo; you could ever want that&amp;rsquo;s available for pay-what-you-want (so probably free).
Given that Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world and regularly sees over 6 million tourist annually, its no surprise that typical German stereotypes are usually steeped in beerâ€”so much so that at least one tourist had to ask on the Fodor&amp;rsquo;s Travel forum: can a non-beer drinker visit Germany?</description>
