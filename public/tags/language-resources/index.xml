      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a language nerd like me, you probably waste hours reading books about languages that you could have spent actually learning one. And now you&amp;rsquo;re reading a review about a book about language learning instead of actually learning a language. So it goes.
Anyhow, this is my first book review for the blog.</description>

      <description>I received a lot of reccomendations of the Pimsleur language programs from family members back when I was preparing to head to Denmark in 2019. So naturally, I picked up Pimsleur Danish 1, never finished it, and forgot about it until about a month ago when I found the little blue Pimsleur logo lurking in my app drawer.</description>

      <title>Is Duolingo bad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Duolingo bad? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard a lot of criticisms of this popular app if you&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging around language learning communities online. Duolingo gets a lot of flack, and there&amp;rsquo;s good reason for that. Nobody is going to reach fluency in a foreign language just by using a game app, and a lot of Duolingo users seem to think they can. Still, I think many critics miss an important point: Duolingo scratches the phone itch. And that&amp;rsquo;s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
