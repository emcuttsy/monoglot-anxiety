      <description>Welcome back to my language diary. Which is apparently biweekly now with posts appearing on either Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on how I feel.
Yes I know bloggers are supposed to be reliable, but my whole &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; is kinda chaos so forgive me this completely in-character 2 day buffer period.</description>

      <title>Is it worth hiring a language tutor as a beginner?</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t book my first lesson with an online tutor until about one and half years after starting to learn German. My lesson was my first conversation in German, but by that point I was already speaking at an intermediate level (about B1 for you CEFR people).
I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;d be a waste of time and money to hire a language tutor as a total beginner.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a language nerd like me, you probably waste hours reading books about languages that you could have spent actually learning one. And now you&amp;rsquo;re reading a review about a book about language learning instead of actually learning a language. So it goes.
Anyhow, this is my first book review for the blog.</description>
