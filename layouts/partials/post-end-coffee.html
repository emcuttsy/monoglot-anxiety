Everything on this site is free — I'm as tired of language bloggers trying to sell me miracle language hacks as you are. But if you want to support the site, I wouldn't say no to a coffee ☕. Monthly supporters keep this blog free of affiliate links, ads, and other crud, and they get some fun perks too.
