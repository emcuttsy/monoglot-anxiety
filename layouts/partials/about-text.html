This isn't another polyglot blog â€” it's a monoglot blog! Well, it used to be. At this point, I'm probably somewhere around a 1.75-glot, maybe a 1.80-glot on a good day. This site is all about learning to learn languages, written through the lense of my experience overcoming the intermediate plateau with German and starting from scratch with Italian as a self-taught former monoglot. If you're teaching yourself a language, this is for you!
